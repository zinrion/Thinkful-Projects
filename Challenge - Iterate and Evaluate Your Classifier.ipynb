    "Version 5 appears to work the best.  The first keywords that I added first due to appear most frequently throughout the dataset had the most impact.  Towards the end as I was combing closer and closer through the data there was only incremental benefit as I added keywords.  There was also great benefit in cleaning up the data by converting all of the sentences to lower case and also stripping out punctuation.  One area I would like to explore further is the benefits of being able to find the most common phrases and adding them to the keywords."
