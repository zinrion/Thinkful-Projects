    "Version 5 involved adding more keywords, as well as one phrase that was identfyied while looking through the data, \"well made\".  Accuracy improved as only 321 points were mislabled.  Sensitivity improved to 41.8% and specificity stayed at 94% versus version three.  Looking from the start the model improved overall in accuracy, specificity and sensitivity.  Version 5 appears to work the best.  The first keywords that I added first due had the most impact. They were added first as they appeared most frequently through the dataset, which aligns with their final imapct.  Towards the end as I was combing closer and closer through the data there was only incremental benefit as I added more keywords. There was also great benefit in cleaning up the data by converting all of the sentences to lower case and also stripping out punctuation.  One area I would like to explore further is the benefits of being able to find the most common phrases and adding them to the keywords. Overfitting does not appear to be an issue as even when the data is segmented for cross validation the sensitivity the accuracy does not appear to meaninfully change."
