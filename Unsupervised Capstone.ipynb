       "'[Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman 1855]\\n\\n\\nCome, said my soul,\\nSuch verses for my Body let us write, (for we are one,)\\nThat should I after return,\\nOr, long, long hence, in other spheres,\\nThere to some group of mates the chants resuming,\\n(Tallying Earth\\'s soil, trees, winds, tumultuous waves,)\\nEver with pleas\\'d smile I may keep on,\\nEver and ever yet the verses owning--as, first, I here and now\\nSigning for Soul and Body, set to them my name,\\n\\nWalt Whitman\\n\\n\\n\\n[BOOK I.  INSCRIPTIONS]\\n\\n}  One\\'s-Self I Sing\\n\\nOne\\'s-self I sing, a simple separate person,\\nYet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.\\n\\nOf physiology from top to toe I sing,\\nNot physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say\\n    the Form complete is worthier far,\\nThe Female equally with the Male I sing.\\n\\nOf Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,\\nCheerful, for freest action form\\'d under the laws divine,\\nThe Modern Man I sing.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  As I Ponder\\'d in Silence\\n\\nAs I ponder\\'d in silence,\\nReturning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,\\nA Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,\\nTerrible in beauty, age, and power,\\nThe genius of poets of old lands,\\nAs to me directing like flame its eyes,\\nWith finger pointing to many immortal songs,\\nAnd menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,\\nKnow\\'st thou not there is hut one theme for ever-enduring bards?\\nAnd that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\\nThe making of perfect soldiers.\\n\\nBe it so, then I answer\\'d,\\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\\n    and retreat, victory deferr\\'d and wavering,\\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\\n    field the world,\\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  In Cabin\\'d Ships at Sea\\n\\nIn cabin\\'d ships at sea,\\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\\nOr some lone bark buoy\\'d on the dense marine,\\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\\n    many a star at night,\\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\\nIn full rapport at last.\\n\\nHere are our thoughts, voyagers\\' thoughts,\\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\\nThe sky o\\'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\\n    briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\\nAnd this is ocean\\'s poem.\\n\\nThen falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\\nYou not a reminiscence of the land alone,\\nYou too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos\\'d I know not\\n    whither, yet ever full of faith,\\nConsort to every ship that sails, sail you!\\nBear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it\\n    here in every leaf;)\\nSpeed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the\\n    imperious waves,\\nChant on, sail on, bear o\\'er the boundless blue from me to every sea,\\nThis song for mariners and all their ships.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To Foreign Lands\\n\\nI heard that you ask\\'d for something to prove this puzzle the New World,\\nAnd to define America, her athletic Democracy,\\nTherefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To a Historian\\n\\nYou who celebrate bygones,\\nWho have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races, the life\\n    that has exhibited itself,\\nWho have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates,\\n    rulers and priests,\\nI, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself\\n    in his own rights,\\nPressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself,\\n    (the great pride of man in himself,)\\nChanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,\\nI project the history of the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To Thee Old Cause\\n\\nTo thee old cause!\\nThou peerless, passionate, good cause,\\nThou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,\\nDeathless throughout the ages, races, lands,\\nAfter a strange sad war, great war for thee,\\n(I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be\\n    really fought, for thee,)\\nThese chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.\\n\\n(A war O soldiers not for itself alone,\\nFar, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this book.)\\n\\nThou orb of many orbs!\\nThou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!\\nAround the idea of thee the war revolving,\\nWith all its angry and vehement play of causes,\\n(With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,)\\nThese recitatives for thee,--my book and the war are one,\\nMerged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,\\nAs a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,\\nAround the idea of thee.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Eidolons\\n\\n     I met a seer,\\nPassing the hues and objects of the world,\\nThe fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,\\n     To glean eidolons.\\n\\n     Put in thy chants said he,\\nNo more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in,\\nPut first before the rest as light for all and entrance-song of all,\\n     That of eidolons.\\n\\n     Ever the dim beginning,\\nEver the growth, the rounding of the circle,\\nEver the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)\\n     Eidolons! eidolons!\\n\\n     Ever the mutable,\\nEver materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering,\\nEver the ateliers, the factories divine,\\n     Issuing eidolons.\\n\\n     Lo, I or you,\\nOr woman, man, or state, known or unknown,\\nWe seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,\\n     But really build eidolons.\\n\\n     The ostent evanescent,\\nThe substance of an artist\\'s mood or savan\\'s studies long,\\nOr warrior\\'s, martyr\\'s, hero\\'s toils,\\n     To fashion his eidolon.\\n\\n     Of every human life,\\n(The units gather\\'d, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)\\nThe whole or large or small summ\\'d, added up,\\n     In its eidolon.\\n\\n     The old, old urge,\\nBased on the ancient pinnacles, lo, newer, higher pinnacles,\\nFrom science and the modern still impell\\'d,\\n     The old, old urge, eidolons.\\n\\n     The present now and here,\\nAmerica\\'s busy, teeming, intricate whirl,\\nOf aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,\\n     To-day\\'s eidolons.\\n\\n     These with the past,\\nOf vanish\\'d lands, of all the reigns of kings across the sea,\\nOld conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors\\' voyages,\\n     Joining eidolons.\\n\\n     Densities, growth, facades,\\nStrata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,\\nFar-born, far-dying, living long, to leave,\\n     Eidolons everlasting.\\n\\n     Exalte, rapt, ecstatic,\\nThe visible but their womb of birth,\\nOf orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape,\\n     The mighty earth-eidolon.\\n\\n     All space, all time,\\n(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,\\nSwelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,)\\n     Fill\\'d with eidolons only.\\n\\n     The noiseless myriads,\\nThe infinite oceans where the rivers empty,\\nThe separate countless free identities, like eyesight,\\n     The true realities, eidolons.\\n\\n     Not this the world,\\nNor these the universes, they the universes,\\nPurport and end, ever the permanent life of life,\\n     Eidolons, eidolons.\\n\\n     Beyond thy lectures learn\\'d professor,\\nBeyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen, beyond all mathematics,\\nBeyond the doctor\\'s surgery, anatomy, beyond the chemist with his chemistry,\\n     The entities of entities, eidolons.\\n\\n     Unfix\\'d yet fix\\'d,\\nEver shall be, ever have been and are,\\nSweeping the present to the infinite future,\\n     Eidolons, eidolons, eidolons.\\n\\n     The prophet and the bard,\\nShall yet maintain themselves, in higher stages yet,\\nShall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy, interpret yet to them,\\n     God and eidolons.\\n\\n     And thee my soul,\\nJoys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations,\\nThy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet,\\n     Thy mates, eidolons.\\n\\n     Thy body permanent,\\nThe body lurking there within thy body,\\nThe only purport of the form thou art, the real I myself,\\n     An image, an eidolon.\\n\\n     Thy very songs not in thy songs,\\nNo special strains to sing, none for itself,\\nBut from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,\\n     A round full-orb\\'d eidolon.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  For Him I Sing\\n\\nFor him I sing,\\nI raise the present on the past,\\n(As some perennial tree out of its roots, the present on the past,)\\nWith time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws,\\nTo make himself by them the law unto himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  When I Read the Book\\n\\nWhen I read the book, the biography famous,\\nAnd is this then (said I) what the author calls a man\\'s life?\\nAnd so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?\\n(As if any man really knew aught of my life,\\nWhy even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life,\\nOnly a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections\\nI seek for my own use to trace out here.)\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Beginning My Studies\\n\\nBeginning my studies the first step pleas\\'d me so much,\\nThe mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\\nThe least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\\nThe first step I say awed me and pleas\\'d me so much,\\nI have hardly gone and hardly wish\\'d to go any farther,\\nBut stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Beginners\\n\\nHow they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,)\\nHow dear and dreadful they are to the earth,\\nHow they inure to themselves as much as to any--what a paradox\\n    appears their age,\\nHow people respond to them, yet know them not,\\nHow there is something relentless in their fate all times,\\nHow all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,\\nAnd how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same\\n    great purchase.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To the States\\n\\nTo the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist\\n    much, obey little,\\nOnce unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved,\\nOnce fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever\\n    afterward resumes its liberty.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  On Journeys Through the States\\n\\nOn journeys through the States we start,\\n(Ay through the world, urged by these songs,\\nSailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)\\nWe willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.\\n\\nWe have watch\\'d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on,\\nAnd have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the\\n    seasons, and effuse as much?\\n\\nWe dwell a while in every city and town,\\nWe pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the\\n    Mississippi, and the Southern States,\\nWe confer on equal terms with each of the States,\\nWe make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear,\\nWe say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the\\n    body and the soul,\\nDwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,\\nAnd what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,\\nAnd may be just as much as the seasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To a Certain Cantatrice\\n\\nHere, take this gift,\\nI was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,\\nOne who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the\\n    progress and freedom of the race,\\nSome brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel;\\nBut I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Me Imperturbe\\n\\nMe imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,\\nMaster of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things,\\nImbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,\\nFinding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less\\n    important than I thought,\\nMe toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee,\\n    or far north or inland,\\nA river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these\\n    States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,\\nMe wherever my life is lived, O to be self-balanced for contingencies,\\nTo confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as\\n    the trees and animals do.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Savantism\\n\\nThither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and\\n    nestling close, always obligated,\\nThither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,\\n    establishments, even the most minute,\\nThither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;\\nThither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,\\nAs a father to his father going takes his children along with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  The Ship Starting\\n\\nLo, the unbounded sea,\\nOn its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even\\n    her moonsails.\\nThe pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately--\\n    below emulous waves press forward,\\nThey surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  I Hear America Singing\\n\\nI hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,\\nThose of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,\\nThe carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,\\nThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,\\nThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand\\n    singing on the steamboat deck,\\nThe shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as\\n    he stands,\\nThe wood-cutter\\'s song, the ploughboy\\'s on his way in the morning,\\n    or at noon intermission or at sundown,\\nThe delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,\\n    or of the girl sewing or washing,\\nEach singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,\\nThe day what belongs to the day--at night the party of young\\n    fellows, robust, friendly,\\nSinging with open mouths their strong melodious songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  What Place Is Besieged?\\n\\nWhat place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?\\nLo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,\\nAnd with him horse and foot, and parks of

an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\\nI am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and\\n    fathomless as myself,\\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\\n\\nEvery kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,\\nFor me those that have been boys and that love women,\\nFor me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,\\nFor me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the\\n    mothers of mothers,\\nFor me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\\nFor me children and the begetters of children.\\n\\nUndrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\\nI see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\\nAnd am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\\n\\n     8\\nThe little one sleeps in its cradle,\\nI lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies\\n    with my hand.\\n\\nThe youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,\\nI peeringly view them from the top.\\n\\nThe suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\\nI witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol\\n    has fallen.\\n\\nThe blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\\n    the promenaders,\\nThe heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the\\n    clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\\nThe snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous\\'d mobs,\\nThe flap of the curtain\\'d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,\\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his\\n    passage to the centre of the crowd,\\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv\\'d who fall sunstruck or in fits,\\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and\\n    give birth to babes,\\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls\\n    restrain\\'d by decorum,\\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances,\\n    rejections with convex lips,\\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them--I come and I depart.\\n\\n     9\\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,\\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\\nThe armfuls are pack\\'d to the sagging mow.\\n\\nI am there, I help, I came stretch\\'d atop of the load,\\nI felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\\nI jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,\\nAnd roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\\n\\n     10\\nAlone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\\nWandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill\\'d game,\\nFalling asleep on the gather\\'d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\\n\\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,\\nMy eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.\\n\\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\\nI tuck\\'d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\\nYou should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\\n\\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west,\\n    the bride was a red girl,\\nHer father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking,\\n    they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets\\n    hanging from their shoulders,\\nOn a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant\\n    beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\\nShe had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks\\n    descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach\\'d to her feet.\\n\\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\\nAnd went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\\nAnd brought water and fill\\'d a tub for his sweated body and bruis\\'d feet,\\nAnd gave him a room that enter\\'d from my own, and gave him some\\n    coarse clean clothes,\\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\\nAnd remember putting piasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass\\'d north,\\nI had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean\\'d in the corner.\\n\\n     11\\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\\nTwenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\\n\\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\\nShe hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.\\n\\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\\nAh the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\\n\\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you,\\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\\n\\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\\n\\nThe beards of the young men glisten\\'d with wet, it ran from their long hair,\\nLittle streams pass\\'d all over their bodies.\\n\\nAn unseen hand also pass\\'d over their bodies,\\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\\n\\nThe young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the\\n    sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,\\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\\n\\n     12\\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife\\n    at the stall in the market,\\nI loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\\n\\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\\nEach has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in\\n    the fire.\\n\\nFrom the cinder-strew\\'d threshold I follow their movements,\\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,\\nOverhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\\nThey do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\\n\\n     13\\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags\\n    underneath on its tied-over chain,\\nThe negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and\\n    tall he stands pois\\'d on one leg on the string-piece,\\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over\\n    his hip-band,\\nHis glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat\\n    away from his forehead,\\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of\\n    his polish\\'d and perfect limbs.\\n\\nI behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,\\nI go with the team also.\\n\\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as\\n    forward sluing,\\nTo niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,\\nAbsorbing all to myself and for this song.\\n\\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what\\n    is that you express in your eyes?\\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\\n\\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and\\n    day-long ramble,\\nThey rise together, they slowly circle around.\\n\\nI believe in those wing\\'d purposes,\\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\\nAnd consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,\\nAnd the in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,\\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\\n\\n     14\\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\\nYa-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\\nThe pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\\nFind its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\\n\\nThe sharp-hoof\\'d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\\n    chickadee, the prairie-dog,\\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\\nThe brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,\\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\\n\\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,\\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\\n\\nI am enamour\\'d of growing out-doors,\\nOf men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\\nOf the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and\\n    mauls, and the drivers of horses,\\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\\n\\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will,\\nScattering it freely forever.\\n\\n     15\\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\\nThe carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane\\n

25\\nDazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,\\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\\n\\nWe also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\\nWe found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\\n\\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\\n\\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\\nWalt you contain enough, why don\\'t you let it out then?\\n\\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you

kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\\n    years ago,\\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\\n\\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\\nThey

ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the\\n    shallow river,\\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the\\n    buck turns furiously at the hunter,\\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the\\n    otter is feeding on fish,\\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the\\n    beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;\\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower\\'d cotton plant, over\\n    the rice in its low moist field,\\nOver the sharp-peak\\'d farm house, with its scallop\\'d scum and\\n    slender shoots from the gutters,\\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav\\'d corn, over the\\n    delicate blue-flower flax,\\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with\\n    the rest,\\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low\\n    scragged limbs,\\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,\\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the

the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it\\n    myself and looking composedly down,)\\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\\n    hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\\nWhere the half-burn\\'d brig is riding on unknown currents,\\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\\nWhere the dense-starr\\'d flag is borne at

hen,\\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,\\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,\\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles\\n    far and near,\\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived\\n    swan is curving and winding,\\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her\\n    near-human laugh,\\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the\\n    high weeds,\\nWhere band-neck\\'d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with\\n    their heads out,\\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch\\'d gates of a cemetery,\\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,\\nWhere the yellow-crown\\'d heron comes to the edge

sweating Methodist preacher,\\n    impress\\'d seriously at the camp-meeting;\\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,\\n    flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn\\'d up to the clouds,\\n    or down a lane or along the beach,\\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek\\'d bush-boy, (behind me\\n    he rides at the drape of the day,)\\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals\\' feet, or the\\n    moccasin print,\\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\\nNigh the coffin\\'d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the\\n    diameter of eighty thousand miles,\\nSpeeding with tail\\'d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\\nI tread day and night such roads.\\n\\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\\nAnd look at quintillions ripen\\'d and look at quintillions green.\\n\\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\\n\\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\\n\\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\\n\\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\\n    pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\\n\\nI ascend to the foretruck,\\nI take my place late at night in the crow\\'s-nest,\\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is\\n    plain in all directions,\\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my\\n    fancies toward them,\\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\\n    be engaged,\\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\\n    feet and caution,\\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin\\'d city,\\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\\n    of the globe.\\n\\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\\nI turn the bridgroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\\n\\nMy voice is the wife\\'s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\\nThey fetch my man\\'s body up dripping and drown\\'d.\\n\\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\\nThe courage of present times and all times,\\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\\n    steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\\n    days and faithful of nights,\\nAnd chalk\\'d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\\n    not desert you;\\nHow he follow\\'d with them and tack\\'d with them three days and\\n    would not give it up,\\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\\nHow the lank loose-gown\\'d women look\\'d when boated from the\\n    side of their prepared graves,\\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\\n    sharp-lipp\\'d unshaved men;\\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\\nI am the man, I suffer\\'d, I was there.\\n\\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\\nThe mother of old, condemn\\'d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\\n    children gazing on,\\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\\n    blowing, cover\\'d with sweat,\\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\\n    buckshot and the bullets,\\nAll these I feel or am.\\n\\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn\\'d with the\\n    ooze of my skin,\\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\\n\\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\\n    wounded person,\\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\\n\\nI am the mash\\'d fireman with breast-bone broken,\\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\\nThey have clear\\'d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\\n\\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\\n    of their fire-caps,\\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\\n\\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\\n\\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort\\'s bombardment,\\nI am there again.\\n\\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\\nAgain to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\\n\\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim\\'d shots,\\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\\n\\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\\n    with his hand,\\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\\n\\n     34\\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\\n\\'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\\n    young men.\\n\\nRetreating they had form\\'d in a hollow square with their baggage for\\n    breastworks,\\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\\n    number, was the price they took in advance,\\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv\\'d writing and\\n    seal, gave up their arms and march\\'d back prisoners of war.\\n\\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\\n\\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\\n    massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\\nThe work commenced about five o\\'clock and was over by eight.\\n\\nNone obey\\'d the command to kneel,\\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\\n    lay together,\\nThe maim\\'d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\\nSome half-kill\\'d attempted to crawl away,\\nThese were despatch\\'d with bayonets or batter\\'d with the blunts of muskets,\\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz\\'d his assassin till two more\\n    came to release him,\\nThe three were all torn and cover\\'d with the boy\\'s blood.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock began the burning of the bodies;\\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\\n\\n     35\\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother\\'s father the sailor told it to me.\\n\\nOur foe was no sulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\\n    and never was, and never will be;\\nAlong the lower\\'d eve he came horribly raking us.\\n\\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch\\'d,\\nMy captain lash\\'d fast with his own hands.\\n\\nWe had receiv\\'d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\\n    killing all around and blowing up overhead.\\n\\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\\nTen o\\'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\\n    and five feet of water reported,\\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\\n    to give them a chance for themselves.\\n\\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\\n\\nOur frigate takes fire,\\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\\n\\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\\n    of the fighting.\\n\\nOnly three guns are in use,\\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy\\'s main-mast,\\nTwo well serv\\'d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\\n    clear his decks.\\n\\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\\n    the main-top,\\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\\n\\nNot a moment\\'s cease,\\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\\n\\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\\n\\nSerene stands the little captain,\\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\\n\\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\\n\\n     36\\nStretch\\'d and still lies the midnight,\\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\\n    one we have conquer\\'d,\\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\\n    countenance white as a sheet,\\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv\\'d in the cabin,\\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\\n    curl\\'d whiskers,\\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\\n    upon the masts and spars,\\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\\n    the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\\nThe hiss of the surgeon\\'s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\\n    dull, tapering groan,\\nThese so, these irretrievable.\\n\\n     37\\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\\nIn at the conquer\\'d doors they crowd! I am possess\\'d!\\nEmbody all presences outlaw\\'d or suffering,\\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain.\\n\\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr\\'d at night.\\n\\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff\\'d to jail but I am handcuff\\'d to him\\n    and walk by his side,\\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\\n    on my twitching lips.)\\n\\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\\n    and sentenced.\\n\\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\\nMy face is ash-color\\'d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\\n\\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\\n\\n     38\\nEnough! enough! enough!\\nSomehow I have been stunn\\'d.

engirth me and I engirth them,\\nThey will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,\\nAnd discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.\\n\\nWas it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?\\nAnd if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?\\nAnd if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?\\nAnd if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?\\n\\n     2\\nThe love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself\\n    balks account,\\nThat of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.\\n\\nThe expression of the face balks account,\\nBut the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,\\nIt is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of\\n    his hips and wrists,\\nIt is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist\\n    and knees, dress does not hide him,\\nThe strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,\\nTo see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,\\nYou linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.\\n\\nThe sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the\\n    folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the\\n    contour of their shape downwards,\\nThe swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through\\n    the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls\\n    silently to and from the heave of the water,\\nThe bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the\\n    horse-man in his saddle,\\nGirls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,\\nThe group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open\\n    dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,\\nThe female soothing a child, the farmer\\'s daughter in the garden or\\n    cow-yard,\\nThe young fellow hosing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six\\n    horses through the crowd,\\nThe wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty,\\n    good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,\\nThe coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,\\nThe upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;\\nThe march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine\\n    muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,\\nThe slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes\\n    suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,\\nThe natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv\\'d\\n    neck and the counting;\\nSuch-like I love--I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother\\'s\\n    breast with the little child,\\nSwim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with\\n    the firemen, and pause, listen, count.\\n\\n     3\\nI knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,\\nAnd in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.\\n\\nThis man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,\\nThe shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and\\n    beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness\\n    and breadth of his manners,\\nThese I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,\\nHe was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were\\n    massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,\\nThey and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,\\nThey did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,\\nHe drank water only, the blood show\\'d like scarlet through the\\n    clear-brown skin of his face,\\nHe was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail\\'d his boat himself, he\\n    had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had\\n    fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,\\nWhen he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,\\n    you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,\\nYou would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit\\n    by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.\\n\\n     4\\nI have perceiv\\'d that to be with those I like is enough,\\nTo stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,\\nTo be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,\\nTo pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly\\n    round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?\\nI do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.\\n\\nThere is something in staying close to men and women and looking\\n    on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,\\nAll things please the soul, but these please the soul well.\\n\\n     5\\nThis is the female form,\\nA divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,\\nIt attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,\\nI am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor,\\n    all falls aside but myself and it,\\nBooks, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what\\n    was expected of heaven or fear\\'d of hell, are now consumed,\\nMad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response\\n    likewise ungovernable,\\nHair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all\\n    diffused, mine too diffused,\\nEbb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling\\n    and deliciously aching,\\nLimitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of\\n    love, white-blow and delirious nice,\\nBridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,\\nUndulating into the willing and yielding day,\\nLost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh\\'d day.\\n\\nThis the nucleus--after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,\\nThis the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the\\n    outlet again.\\n\\nBe not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the\\n    exit of the rest,\\nYou are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.\\n\\nThe female contains all qualities and tempers them,\\nShe is in her place and moves with perfect balance,\\nShe is all things duly veil\\'d, she is both passive and active,\\nShe is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\\n\\nAs I see my soul reflected in Nature,\\nAs I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness,\\n    sanity, beauty,\\nSee the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.\\n\\n     6\\nThe male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,\\nHe too is all qualities, he is action and power,\\nThe flush of the known universe is in him,\\nScorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,\\nThe wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is\\n    utmost become him well, pride is for him,\\nThe full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,\\nKnowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to\\n    the test of himself,\\nWhatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes\\n    soundings at last only here,\\n(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)\\n\\nThe man\\'s body is sacred and the woman\\'s body is sacred,\\nNo matter who it is, it is sacred--is it the meanest one in the\\n    laborers\\' gang?\\nIs it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?\\nEach belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as\\n    much as you,\\nEach has his or her place in the procession.\\n\\n(All is a procession,\\nThe universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)\\n\\nDo you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?\\nDo you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has\\n    no right to a sight?\\nDo you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and\\n    the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,\\nFor you only, and not for him and her?\\n\\n     7\\nA man\\'s body at auction,\\n(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart

it,\\nFor it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one\\n    animal or plant,\\nFor it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll\\'d.\\n\\nIn this head the all-baffling brain,\\nIn it and below it the makings of heroes.\\n\\nExamine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in\\n    tendon and nerve,\\nThey shall be stript that you may see them.\\n\\nExquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,\\nFlakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby,\\n    good-sized arms and legs,\\nAnd wonders within there yet.\\n\\nWithin there runs blood,\\nThe same old blood! the same red-running blood!\\nThere swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires,\\n    reachings, aspirations,\\n(Do you think they are not there because they are not express\\'d in\\n    parlors and lecture-rooms?)\\n\\nThis is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be\\n    fathers in their turns,\\nIn him the start of populous states and rich

   1\\nAfoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,\\nHealthy, free, the world before me,\\nThe long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\\n\\nHenceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,\\nHenceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,\\nDone with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,\\nStrong and content I travel the open road.\\n\\nThe earth, that is sufficient,\\nI do not want the constellations any nearer,\\nI know they are very well where they are,\\nI know they suffice for those who belong to them.\\n\\n(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,\\nI carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,\\nI swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,\\nI am fill\\'d with them, and I will fill them in return.)\\n\\n     2\\nYou road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all\\n    that is here,\\nI believe that much unseen is also here.\\n\\nHere the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,\\nThe black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas\\'d, the\\n    illiterate person, are not denied;\\nThe birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar\\'s tramp, the\\n    drunkard\\'s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,\\nThe escaped youth, the rich person\\'s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,\\nThe early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the\\n    town, the return back from the town,\\nThey pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,\\nNone but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.\\n\\n     3\\nYou air that serves me with breath to speak!\\nYou objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\\nYou light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable

at the edges!\\nYou ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\\n    side! you distant ships!\\nYou rows of houses! you window-pierc\\'d facades! you roofs!\\nYou porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\\nYou windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\\nYou doors and ascending steps! you arches!\\nYou gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\\nFrom all that has touch\\'d you I believe you have imparted to\\n    yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,\\nFrom the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,\\n    and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\\n\\n     4\\nThe earth expanding right hand and left hand,\\nThe picture alive, every part in its best

considering well what they say,\\nPausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,\\nGently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that\\n    would hold me.\\n\\nI inhale great draughts of space,\\nThe east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.\\n\\nI am larger, better than I thought,\\nI did not know I held so much goodness.\\n\\nAll seems beautiful to

thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,\\nNow if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear\\'d it would not\\n    astonish me.\\n\\nNow I see the secret of the making of the best

of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all\\n    authority and all argument against it.)\\n\\nHere is the test of wisdom,\\nWisdom is not finally tested in schools,\\nWisdom cannot be pass\\'d from one having it to another not having it,\\nWisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,\\nApplies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,\\nIs the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the\\n    excellence of things;\\nSomething there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\\n    it out of the soul.\\n\\nNow I re-examine philosophies and religions,\\nThey may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the\\n    spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\\n\\nHere is realization,\\nHere is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,\\nThe past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you\\n    are vacant of them.\\n\\nOnly the kernel of every object nourishes;\\nWhere is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\\nWhere is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\\n\\nHere is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion\\'d, it is apropos;\\nDo you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\\nDo you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\\n\\n     7\\nHere is the efflux of the soul,\\nThe efflux of the soul comes from within through embower\\'d gates,\\n    ever provoking questions,\\nThese yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\\nWhy are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\\n    expands my blood?\\nWhy when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\\nWhy are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\\n    thoughts descend upon me?\\n(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\\n    drop fruit as I pass;)\\nWhat is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\\nWhat with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\\nWhat with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\\n    and pause?\\nWhat gives me to be free to a woman\\'s and man\\'s good-will? what\\n    gives them to be free to mine?\\n\\n     8\\nThe efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,\\nI think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,\\nNow it flows unto us, we are rightly

the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\\nThe current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\\nThe others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\\nThe certainty

signs. And I stand before the young man\\n    face to face, and take his right hand in my left hand and his\\n    left hand in my right hand,\\nAnd I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him that\\n    answers for all, and send these signs.\\n\\nHim all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,\\nHim they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light,\\nHim they immerse and he immerses them.\\n\\nBeautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,\\n    people, animals,\\nThe profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so\\n    tell I my morning\\'s romanza,)\\nAll enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money will buy,\\nThe best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,\\nThe noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he\\n    domiciles there,\\nNothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,\\n    the ships in the offing,\\nThe perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody.\\n\\nHe puts things in their attitudes,\\nHe puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,\\nHe places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and\\n    sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest\\n    never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.\\n\\nHe is the Answerer,\\nWhat can be answer\\'d he answers, and what cannot be answer\\'d he\\n    shows how it cannot be answer\\'d.\\n\\nA man is a summons and challenge,\\n(It is vain to skulk--do you hear that mocking and laughter? do you\\n    hear the ironical echoes?)\\n\\nBooks, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,\\n    beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,\\nHe indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and\\n    down also.\\n\\nWhichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly\\n    and gently and safely by day or by night,\\nHe has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the prying of\\n    hands on the knobs.\\n\\nHis welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome or\\n    universal than he is,\\nThe person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.\\n\\nEvery existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,\\nHe resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and\\n    any man translates, and any man translates himself also,\\nOne part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees\\n    how they join.\\n\\nHe says indifferently and alike How are you friend? to the President\\n    at his levee,\\nAnd he says Good-day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,\\nAnd both understand him and know that his speech is right.\\n\\nHe walks with

the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that\\n    he has follow\\'d the sea,\\nAnd the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\\nAnd the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,\\nNo matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has\\n    follow\\'d it,\\nNo matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and\\n

dark,\\nThe maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\\nHis insight and power encircle things and the human race,\\nHe is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.\\n\\nThe singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,\\nThe singers are welcom\\'d, understood, appear often enough, but rare\\n    has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker\\n    of poems, the Answerer,\\n(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain\\'d such a\\n    day, for all its names.)\\n\\nThe singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible\\n    names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,\\nThe name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,\\n    sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer,\\n    weird-singer, or something else.\\n\\nAll this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,\\nThe words of true poems do not merely please,\\nThe true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;\\nThe greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers\\n    and fathers,\\nThe words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\\n\\nDivine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,\\n    rudeness of body, withdrawnness,\\nGayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems.\\n\\nThe sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,\\nThe builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all\\n    these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.\\n\\nThe words of the true poems give you more than poems,\\nThey give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,\\n    peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,\\nThey balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,\\nThey do not seek beauty, they are sought,\\nForever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,\\n    fain, love-sick.\\n\\nThey prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\\nThey bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,\\nWhom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to\\n    learn one of the meanings,\\nTo launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless\\n    rings and never be quiet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n[BOOK X]\\n\\n}  Our Old Feuillage\\n\\nAlways our

appear again, the old hoop\\'d guns are mounted,\\nI see the lines of rais\\'d earth stretching from river to bay,\\nI mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;\\nHere we lay encamp\\'d, it was this time in summer also.\\n\\nAs I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,\\nIt was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,\\nBy his staff surrounded

could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,\\nAnd the transports swarming with soldiers.\\n\\nA few days more and they landed, and then the battle.\\n\\nTwenty thousand were brought against us,\\nA veteran force furnish\\'d with good artillery.\\n\\nI tell not now the whole of the battle,\\nBut one brigade early in the forenoon order\\'d forward to engage the\\n    red-coats,\\nOf that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march\\'d,\\nAnd how long and well it stood confronting death.\\n\\nWho do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?\\nIt was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\\nRais\\'d in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally\\n    to the General.\\n\\nJauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus\\' waters,\\nTill of a sudden unlook\\'d for by defiles through the woods, gain\\'d at night,\\nThe British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing\\n    their guns,\\nThat brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy\\'s mercy.\\n\\nThe General watch\\'d them from this hill,\\nThey made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,\\nThen drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,\\nBut O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\\n\\nIt sickens me yet, that slaughter!\\nI saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\\nI saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\\n\\nMeanwhile the British manoeuvr\\'d to draw us out for a pitch\\'d battle,\\nBut we dared not trust the chances of a pitch\\'d battle.\\n\\nWe fought the fight in detachments,\\nSallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was\\n    against us,\\nOur foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push\\'d us back\\n    to the works on this hill,\\nTill we turn\\'d menacing here, and then he left us.\\n\\nThat was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand\\n    strong,\\nFew return\\'d, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\\n\\nThat and here my General\\'s first battle,\\nNo women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude\\n    with applause,\\nNobody clapp\\'d hands here then.\\n\\nBut in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\\nWearied that night we lay foil\\'d and sullen,\\nWhile scornfully laugh\\'d many an arrogant lord off against us encamp\\'d,\\nQuite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over\\n    their victory.\\n\\nSo dull and damp and another day,\\nBut the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\\nSilent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my\\n    General retreated.\\n\\nI saw him at the river-side,\\nDown by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\\nMy General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass\\'d over,\\nAnd then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for\\n    the last time.\\n\\nEvery one else seem\\'d fill\\'d with gloom,\\nMany no doubt thought of capitulation.\\n\\nBut when my General pass\\'d me,\\nAs he stood in his boat and look\\'d toward the coming sun,\\nI saw something different from capitulation.\\n\\n     [Terminus]\\nEnough, the Centenarian\\'s story ends,\\nThe two, the past and present, have interchanged,\\nI myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now

return,\\nIt is the 27th of August and the British have landed,\\nThe battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke\\n    Washington\\'s face,\\nThe brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march\\'d forth to intercept\\n    the enemy,\\nThey are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,\\nRank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\\nBaptized that

affects him or her in a day,\\n    month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,\\nBut the same affects him or her onward afterward through the\\n    indirect lifetime.\\n\\nThe indirect is just as much as the direct,\\nThe spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the\\n    body, if not more.\\n\\nNot one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of\\n    the onanist,\\nPutridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,\\n    betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,\\nBut has results beyond death as really as before death.\\n\\nCharity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing.\\n\\nNo specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that\\n    is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,\\nIn the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope\\n    of it forever.\\n\\nWho has been wise receives interest,\\nSavage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,\\n    young, old, it is the same,\\nThe interest will come round--all will come round.\\n\\nSingly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever

children, widows, the sick, and to shunn\\'d persons,\\nAll self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw\\n    others fill the seats of the boats,\\nAll offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a\\n    friend\\'s sake, or opinion\\'s sake,\\nAll pains of enthusiasts scoff\\'d at by their neighbors,\\nAll the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,\\nAll honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,\\nAll the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,\\nAll the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown

life from every part,\\nDivides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,\\nMatches every thought or act by its correlative,\\nKnows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,\\nKnows that the young man who composedly peril\\'d his life and lost it\\n    has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,\\nThat he who never peril\\'d his life, but retains it to old age in\\n    riches and ease, has probably achiev\\'d nothing for himself worth\\n    mentioning,\\nKnows that only that person has really learn\\'d who has learn\\'d to\\n    prefer

vision,\\nStepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,\\nBending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,\\nWandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,\\nPausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.\\n\\nHow solemn they look there, stretch\\'d and still,\\nHow quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.\\n\\nThe wretched features of ennuyes, the white features of corpses, the\\n    livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,\\nThe gash\\'d bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their\\n    strong-door\\'d rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging\\n    from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,\\nThe night pervades them and infolds them.\\n\\nThe married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on\\n    the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,\\nThe sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,\\nThe men sleep lovingly side by side

sleeps,\\nThe head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,\\nAnd the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.\\n\\nI stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering

neither ground nor sea.\\n\\nWell do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,\\nOnly from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,\\nI reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet

blackguards! with mirth-shouting\\n    music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!\\n\\nI am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,\\nThe emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,\\nHe who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,\\nThe stammerer, the well-form\\'d person, the wasted or feeble person.\\n\\nI am she who adorn\\'d herself and folded her hair expectantly,\\nMy truant lover has come, and it is dark.\\n\\nDouble yourself and receive me darkness,\\nReceive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him.\\n\\nI roll myself upon

his flesh was sweaty and panting,\\nI feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.\\n\\nMy hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,\\nI would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.\\n\\nBe careful darkness! already what was it touch\\'d me?\\nI thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,\\nI hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.\\n\\n     2\\nI descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,\\nPerfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.\\n\\nIt is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman\\'s,\\nI sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson\\'s\\n    stockings.\\n\\nIt is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,\\nI see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.\\n\\nA shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,\\nIt is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is\\n    blank here, for reasons.\\n\\n(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy,\\nWhoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)\\n\\n     3\\nI see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies\\n    of the sea,\\nHis brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with\\n    courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,\\nI see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,\\nI hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on\\n    the rocks.\\n\\nWhat are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\\nWill you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime\\n    of his middle age?\\n\\nSteady and long he struggles,\\nHe is baffled, bang\\'d, bruis\\'d, he holds out while his strength\\n    holds out,\\nThe slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,\\n    they roll him, swing him, turn him,\\nHis beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is\\n    continually bruis\\'d on rocks,\\nSwiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.\\n\\n     4\\nI turn but do not extricate myself,\\nConfused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.\\n\\nThe beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,\\nThe tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\\n\\nI look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as\\n    she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.\\n\\nI cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\\nI can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\\n\\nI search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash\\'d to us alive,\\nIn the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\\n\\n     5\\nNow of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\\nWashington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench\\'d\\n    hills amid a crowd of officers.\\nHis face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,\\nHe lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch\\'d\\n    from his cheeks,\\nHe sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by\\n    their parents.\\n\\nThe same at last and at last when peace is declared,\\nHe stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov\\'d soldiers\\n    all pass through,\\nThe officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\\nThe chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,\\nHe kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands\\n    and bids good-by to the army.\\n\\n     6\\nNow what my

  pliant limbs,\\nThe more she look\\'d upon her she loved her,\\nNever before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\\nShe made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook\\'d\\n    food for her,\\nShe had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\\n\\nThe red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the\\n    afternoon she went away,\\nO my mother was loth to have her go away,\\nAll the week she thought of her, she watch\\'d for her many a month,\\nShe remember\\'d her many a winter and many a summer,\\nBut the red squaw

yet to the models departed, caste, myths,\\n    obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,\\nHow few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or\\n    see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results,\\n(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious\\n    and inevitable, and they again leading to other results.)\\n\\nHow the great cities appear--how the Democratic masses, turbulent,\\n    willful, as I love them,\\nHow the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the\\n    sounding and resounding, keep on and on,\\nHow society waits unform\\'d, and is for a while between things ended\\n    and things begun,\\nHow America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of\\n    freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and\\n    of all that is begun,\\nAnd how the States are complete in themselves--and how all triumphs\\n    and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,\\nAnd how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be\\n    convuls\\'d, and serve other parturitions and transitions,\\nAnd how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses too,\\n    serve--and how every fact, and war itself, with all its horrors,\\n    serves,\\nAnd how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death.\\n\\n     2\\nOf seeds dropping into the ground, of births,\\nOf the steady concentration of America, inland, upward, to\\n    impregnable and swarming places,\\nOf what Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and the rest, are to be,\\nOf what a few years will show there in
