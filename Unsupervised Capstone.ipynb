INSCRIPTIONS]\\n\\n}  One\\'s-Self I Sing\\n\\nOne\\'s-self I sing, a simple separate person,\\nYet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.\\n\\nOf physiology from top to toe I sing,\\nNot physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say\\n    the Form complete is worthier far,\\nThe Female equally with the Male I sing.\\n\\nOf Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,\\nCheerful, for freest action form\\'d under the laws divine,\\nThe Modern Man I sing.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  As I Ponder\\'d in Silence\\n\\nAs I ponder\\'d in silence,\\nReturning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,\\nA Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,\\nTerrible in beauty, age, and power,\\nThe genius of poets of old lands,\\nAs to me directing like flame its eyes,\\nWith finger pointing to many immortal songs,\\nAnd menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,\\nKnow\\'st thou not there is hut one theme for ever-enduring bards?\\nAnd that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\\nThe making of perfect soldiers.\\n\\nBe it so, then I answer\\'d,\\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\\n    and retreat, victory deferr\\'d and wavering,\\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\\n    field the world,\\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  In Cabin\\'d Ships at Sea\\n\\nIn cabin\\'d ships at sea,\\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\\nOr some lone bark buoy\\'d on the dense marine,\\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\\n    many a star at night,\\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\\nIn full rapport at last.\\n\\nHere are our thoughts, voyagers\\' thoughts,\\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\\nThe sky o\\'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\\n    briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\\nAnd this is ocean\\'s poem.\\n\\nThen falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\\nYou not a reminiscence of the land alone,\\nYou too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos\\'d I know not\\n    whither, yet ever full of faith,\\nConsort to every ship that sails, sail you!\\nBear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it\\n    here in every leaf;)\\nSpeed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the\\n    imperious waves,\\nChant on, sail on, bear o\\'er the boundless blue from me to every sea,\\nThis song for mariners and all their ships.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To Foreign Lands\\n\\nI heard that you ask\\'d for something to prove this puzzle the New World,\\nAnd to define America, her athletic Democracy,\\nTherefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To a Historian\\n\\nYou who celebrate bygones,\\nWho have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races, the life\\n    that has exhibited itself,\\nWho have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates,\\n    rulers and priests,\\nI, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself\\n    in his own rights,\\nPressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself,\\n    (the great pride of man in himself,)\\nChanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,\\nI project the history of the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To Thee Old Cause\\n\\nTo thee old cause!\\nThou peerless, passionate, good cause,\\nThou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,\\nDeathless throughout the ages, races, lands,\\nAfter a strange sad war, great war for thee,\\n(I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be\\n    really fought, for thee,)\\nThese chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.\\n\\n(A war O soldiers not for itself alone,\\nFar, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this book.)\\n\\nThou orb of many orbs!\\nThou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!\\nAround the idea of thee the war revolving,\\nWith all its angry and vehement play of causes,\\n(With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,)\\nThese recitatives for thee,--my book and the war are one,\\nMerged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,\\nAs a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,\\nAround the idea of thee.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Eidolons\\n\\n     I met a seer,\\nPassing the hues and objects of the world,\\nThe fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,\\n     To glean eidolons.\\n\\n     Put in thy chants said he,\\nNo more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in,\\nPut first before the rest as light for all and entrance-song of all,\\n     That of eidolons.\\n\\n     Ever the dim beginning,\\nEver the growth, the rounding of the circle,\\nEver the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)\\n     Eidolons! eidolons!\\n\\n     Ever the mutable,\\nEver materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering,\\nEver the ateliers, the factories divine,\\n     Issuing eidolons.\\n\\n     Lo, I or you,\\nOr woman, man, or state, known or unknown,\\nWe seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,\\n     But really build eidolons.\\n\\n     The ostent evanescent,\\nThe substance of an artist\\'s mood or savan\\'s studies long,\\nOr warrior\\'s, martyr\\'s, hero\\'s toils,\\n     To fashion his eidolon.\\n\\n     Of every human life,\\n(The units gather\\'d, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)\\nThe whole or large or small summ\\'d, added up,\\n     In its eidolon.\\n\\n     The old, old

here,\\nAmerica\\'s busy, teeming, intricate whirl,\\nOf aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,\\n     To-day\\'s eidolons.\\n\\n     These with the past,\\nOf vanish\\'d lands, of all the reigns of kings across the sea,\\nOld conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors\\' voyages,\\n     Joining eidolons.\\n\\n     Densities, growth, facades,\\nStrata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,\\nFar-born, far-dying, living long, to leave,\\n     Eidolons everlasting.\\n\\n     Exalte, rapt, ecstatic,\\nThe visible but their womb of birth,\\nOf orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape,\\n     The mighty earth-eidolon.\\n\\n     All space, all time,\\n(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,\\nSwelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,)\\n     Fill\\'d with eidolons only.\\n\\n     The noiseless myriads,\\nThe infinite oceans where the rivers empty,\\nThe separate countless free identities, like eyesight,\\n     The true realities,

of entities, eidolons.\\n\\n     Unfix\\'d yet fix\\'d,\\nEver shall be, ever have been and are,\\nSweeping the present to the infinite future,\\n     Eidolons, eidolons, eidolons.\\n\\n     The prophet and the bard,\\nShall yet maintain themselves, in higher stages yet,\\nShall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy, interpret yet to them,\\n     God and eidolons.\\n\\n     And thee my soul,\\nJoys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations,\\nThy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet,\\n     Thy mates, eidolons.\\n\\n     Thy body permanent,\\nThe body lurking there within thy body,\\nThe only purport of the form thou art, the real I myself,\\n     An image, an eidolon.\\n\\n     Thy very songs not in thy songs,\\nNo special strains to sing, none for itself,\\nBut from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,\\n     A round full-orb\\'d eidolon.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  For Him I Sing\\n\\nFor him I sing,\\nI raise the present on the past,\\n(As some perennial tree out of its roots, the present on the past,)\\nWith time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws,\\nTo make himself by them the law unto himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  When I Read the Book\\n\\nWhen I read the book, the biography famous,\\nAnd is this then (said I) what the author calls a man\\'s life?\\nAnd so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?\\n(As if any man really knew aught of my life,\\nWhy even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life,\\nOnly a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections\\nI seek for my own use to trace out here.)\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Beginning My Studies\\n\\nBeginning my studies the first step pleas\\'d me so much,\\nThe mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\\nThe least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\\nThe first step I say awed me and pleas\\'d me so much,\\nI have hardly gone and hardly wish\\'d to go any farther,\\nBut stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Beginners\\n\\nHow they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,)\\nHow dear and dreadful they are to the earth,\\nHow they inure to themselves as much as to any--what a paradox\\n    appears their age,\\nHow people respond to them, yet know them not,\\nHow there is something relentless in their fate all times,\\nHow all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,\\nAnd how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same\\n    great purchase.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To the States\\n\\nTo the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist\\n    much, obey little,\\nOnce unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved,\\nOnce fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever\\n    afterward resumes its liberty.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  On Journeys Through the States\\n\\nOn journeys through the States we start,\\n(Ay through the world, urged by these songs,\\nSailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)\\nWe willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.\\n\\nWe have watch\\'d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on,\\nAnd have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the\\n    seasons, and effuse as much?\\n\\nWe dwell a while in every city and town,\\nWe pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the\\n    Mississippi, and the Southern States,\\nWe confer on equal terms with each of the States,\\nWe make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear,\\nWe say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the\\n    body and the soul,\\nDwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,\\nAnd what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,\\nAnd may be just as much as the seasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To a Certain Cantatrice\\n\\nHere, take this gift,\\nI was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,\\nOne who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the\\n    progress and freedom of the race,\\nSome brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel;\\nBut I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Me Imperturbe\\n\\nMe imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,\\nMaster of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things,\\nImbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,\\nFinding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less\\n    important than I thought,\\nMe toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee,\\n    or far north or inland,\\nA river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these\\n    States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,\\nMe wherever my life is lived, O to be self-balanced for contingencies,\\nTo confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as\\n    the trees and animals do.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Savantism\\n\\nThither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and\\n    nestling close, always obligated,\\nThither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,\\n    establishments, even the most minute,\\nThither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;\\nThither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,\\nAs a father to his father going takes his children along with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  The Ship Starting\\n\\nLo, the unbounded sea,\\nOn its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even\\n    her moonsails.\\nThe pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately--\\n    below emulous waves press forward,\\nThey surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  I Hear America Singing\\n\\nI hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,\\nThose of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,\\nThe carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,\\nThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,\\nThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand\\n    singing on the steamboat deck,\\nThe shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as\\n    he stands,\\nThe wood-cutter\\'s song, the ploughboy\\'s on his way in the morning,\\n    or at noon intermission or at sundown,\\nThe delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,\\n    or of the girl sewing or washing,\\nEach singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,\\nThe day what belongs to the day--at night the party of young\\n    fellows, robust, friendly,\\nSinging with open mouths their strong melodious songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  What Place Is Besieged?\\n\\nWhat place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?\\nLo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,\\nAnd with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,\\nAnd artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Still Though the One I Sing\\n\\nStill though the one I sing,\\n(One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to

room that enter\\'d from my own, and gave him some\\n    coarse clean clothes,\\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\\nAnd remember putting piasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass\\'d north,\\nI had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean\\'d in the corner.\\n\\n     11\\nTwenty-eight young men

out.\\n\\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\\nNot asking

25\\nDazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,\\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\\n\\nWe also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\\nWe found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\\n\\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\\n\\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\\nWalt you contain enough, why don\\'t you let it out then?\\n\\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\\n    articulation,\\nDo you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?\\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost,\\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\\nI underlying causes to balance them at last,\\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,\\nHappiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search\\n    of this day.)\\n\\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,\\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\\n\\nWriting and talk do not prove me,\\nI carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\\n\\n     26\\nNow I will do nothing but listen,\\nTo accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.\\n\\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames,\\n    clack of sticks cooking my meals,\\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,\\nSounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,\\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of\\n    work-people at their meals,\\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,\\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing\\n    a death-sentence,\\nThe heave\\'e\\'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the\\n    refrain of the anchor-lifters,\\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking\\n    engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color\\'d lights,\\nThe steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,\\nThe slow march play\\'d at the head of the association marching two and two,\\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\\n\\nI hear the violoncello, (\\'tis the young man\\'s heart\\'s complaint,)\\nI hear the key\\'d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\\n\\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\\nAh this indeed is music--this suits me.\\n\\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\\n\\nI hear the train\\'d soprano (what work with hers is this?)\\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\\nIt wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess\\'d them,\\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick\\'d by the indolent waves,\\nI am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\\nSteep\\'d amid honey\\'d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,\\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\\nAnd that we call Being.\\n\\n     27\\nTo be in any form, what is that?\\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)\\nIf nothing lay more develop\\'d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\\n\\nMine is no callous shell,\\nI have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\\n\\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\\nTo touch my person to some one else\\'s is about as much as I can stand.\\n\\n     28\\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly\\n    different from myself,\\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\\nDepriving me of my best as for a purpose,\\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\\nThey bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,\\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,\\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\\n\\nThe sentries desert every other part of me,\\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder,\\nThey all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.\\n\\nI am given up by traitors,\\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\\n    greatest traitor,\\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.\\n\\nYou villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,\\nUnclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\\n\\n     29\\nBlind loving wrestling touch, sheath\\'d hooded sharp-tooth\\'d touch!\\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\\n\\nParting track\\'d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,\\nRich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\\n\\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,\\nLandscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\\n\\n     30\\nAll truths wait in all things,\\nThey neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any,\\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\\n\\nLogic and sermons never convince,\\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\\n\\n(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\\nOnly what nobody denies is so.)\\n\\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\\n    becomes omnific,\\nAnd until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\\n\\n     31\\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars,\\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg\\n    of the wren,\\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d\\'oeuvre for the highest,\\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\\nAnd the cow crunching with depress\\'d head surpasses any statue,\\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\\n\\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\\n    grains, esculent roots,\\nAnd am stucco\\'d with quadrupeds and birds all over,\\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\\nBut call any thing back again when I desire it.\\n\\nIn vain the speeding or shyness,\\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,\\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder\\'d bones,\\nIn vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\\nIn vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,\\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\\nIn vain the razor-bill\\'d auk sails far north to Labrador,\\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\\n\\n     32\\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and\\n    self-contain\\'d,\\nI stand and look at them long and long.\\n\\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\\n    owning things,\\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\\n    years ago,\\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\\n\\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their\\n    possession.\\n\\nI wonder where they get those tokens,\\nDid I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?\\n\\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\\n\\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\\n\\nHis nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.\\n\\nI but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\\nWhy do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\\nEven as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\\n\\n     33\\nSpace and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess\\'d at,\\nWhat I guess\\'d when I loaf\\'d on the grass,\\nWhat I guess\\'d while I lay alone in my bed,\\nAnd again as I walk\\'d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\\n\\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\\nI skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\\nI am afoot with my vision.\\n\\nBy the city\\'s quadrangular houses--in log huts, camping with lumber-men,\\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,\\nWeeding my onion-patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips,\\n    crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,\\nScorch\\'d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the\\n    shallow river,\\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the\\n    buck turns furiously at the hunter,\\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the\\n    otter is feeding on fish,\\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the\\n    beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;\\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower\\'d cotton plant, over\\n    the rice in its low moist field,\\nOver the sharp-peak\\'d farm house, with its scallop\\'d scum and\\n    slender shoots from the gutters,\\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav\\'d corn, over the\\n    delicate blue-flower flax,\\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with\\n    the rest,\\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low\\n    scragged limbs,\\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,\\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,\\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\\n    goldbug drops through the dark,\\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to\\n    the meadow,\\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\\n    shuddering of their hides,\\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle\\n    the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,\\nWherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,\\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it\\n    myself and looking composedly down,)\\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\\n    hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\\nWhere the half-burn\\'d brig is riding on unknown currents,\\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\\nWhere the dense-starr\\'d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,\\nApproaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,\\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,\\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of\\n    base-ball,\\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\\n    bull-dances, drinking, laughter,\\nAt the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the\\n    juice through a straw,\\nAt apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\\nAt musters,

dry-stalks are\\n    scatter\\'d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to\\n    the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,\\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,\\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles\\n    far and near,\\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived\\n    swan is curving and winding,\\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her\\n    near-human laugh,\\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the\\n    high weeds,\\nWhere band-neck\\'d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with\\n    their heads out,\\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch\\'d gates of a cemetery,\\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,\\nWhere the yellow-crown\\'d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at\\n    night and feeds upon small crabs,\\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,\\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over\\n    the well,\\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,\\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtain\\'d saloon, through the\\n    office or public hall;\\nPleas\\'d with the native and pleas\\'d with the foreign, pleas\\'d with\\n    the new and old,\\nPleas\\'d with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\\nPleas\\'d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,\\nPleas\\'d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash\\'d church,\\nPleas\\'d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,\\n    impress\\'d seriously at the camp-meeting;\\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,\\n    flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn\\'d up to the clouds,\\n    or down a lane or along the beach,\\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek\\'d bush-boy, (behind me\\n    he rides at the drape of the day,)\\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals\\' feet, or the\\n    moccasin print,\\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\\nNigh the coffin\\'d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the\\n    diameter of eighty thousand miles,\\nSpeeding with tail\\'d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\\nI tread day and night such roads.\\n\\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\\nAnd look at quintillions ripen\\'d and look at quintillions green.\\n\\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\\n\\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\\n\\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\\n\\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\\n    pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\\n\\nI ascend to the foretruck,\\nI take my place late at night in the crow\\'s-nest,\\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is\\n    plain in all directions,\\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my\\n    fancies toward them,\\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\\n    be engaged,\\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\\n    feet and caution,\\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin\\'d city,\\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\\n    of the globe.\\n\\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\\nI turn the bridgroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\\n\\nMy voice is the wife\\'s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\\nThey fetch my man\\'s body up dripping and drown\\'d.\\n\\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\\nThe courage of present times and all times,\\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\\n    steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\\n    days and faithful of nights,\\nAnd chalk\\'d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\\n    not desert you;\\nHow he follow\\'d with them and tack\\'d with them three days and\\n    would not give it up,\\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\\nHow the lank loose-gown\\'d women look\\'d when boated from the\\n    side of their prepared graves,\\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\\n    sharp-lipp\\'d unshaved men;\\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\\nI am the man, I suffer\\'d, I was there.\\n\\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\\nThe mother of old, condemn\\'d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\\n    children gazing on,\\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\\n    blowing, cover\\'d with sweat,\\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\\n    buckshot and the bullets,\\nAll these I feel or am.\\n\\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn\\'d with the\\n    ooze of my skin,\\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\\n\\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\\n    wounded person,\\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\\n\\nI am the mash\\'d fireman with breast-bone broken,\\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\\nThey have clear\\'d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\\n\\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\\n    of their fire-caps,\\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\\n\\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\\n\\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort\\'s bombardment,\\nI am there again.\\n\\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\\nAgain to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\\n\\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim\\'d shots,\\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\\n\\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\\n    with his hand,\\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\\n\\n     34\\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\\n\\'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\\n    young men.\\n\\nRetreating they had form\\'d in a hollow square with their baggage for\\n    breastworks,\\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\\n    number, was the price they took in advance,\\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv\\'d writing and\\n    seal, gave up their arms and march\\'d back prisoners of war.\\n\\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\\n\\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\\n    massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\\nThe work commenced about five o\\'clock and was over by eight.\\n\\nNone obey\\'d the command to kneel,\\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\\n    lay together,\\nThe maim\\'d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\\nSome half-kill\\'d attempted to crawl away,\\nThese were despatch\\'d with bayonets or batter\\'d with the blunts of muskets,\\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz\\'d his assassin till two more\\n    came to release him,\\nThe three were all torn and cover\\'d with the boy\\'s blood.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock began the burning of the bodies;\\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\\n\\n     35\\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother\\'s father the sailor told it to me.\\n\\nOur foe was no sulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\\n    and never was, and never will be;\\nAlong the lower\\'d eve he came horribly raking us.\\n\\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch\\'d,\\nMy captain lash\\'d fast with his own hands.\\n\\nWe had receiv\\'d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\\n    killing all around and blowing up overhead.\\n\\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\\nTen o\\'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\\n    and five feet of water reported,\\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\\n    to give them a chance for themselves.\\n\\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\\n\\nOur frigate takes fire,\\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\\n\\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\\n    of the fighting.\\n\\nOnly three guns are in use,\\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy\\'s main-mast,\\nTwo well serv\\'d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\\n    clear his decks.\\n\\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\\n    the main-top,\\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\\n\\nNot a moment\\'s cease,\\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\\n\\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\\n\\nSerene stands the little captain,\\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\\n\\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\\n\\n     36\\nStretch\\'d and still lies the midnight,\\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\\n    one we have conquer\\'d,\\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\\n    countenance white as a sheet,\\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv\\'d in the cabin,\\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\\n    curl\\'d whiskers,\\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\\n    upon the masts and spars,\\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\\n    the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\\nThe hiss of the surgeon\\'s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\\n    dull, tapering groan,\\nThese so, these irretrievable.\\n\\n     37\\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\\nIn at the conquer\\'d doors they crowd! I am possess\\'d!\\nEmbody all presences outlaw\\'d or suffering,\\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain.\\n\\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr\\'d at night.\\n\\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff\\'d to jail but I am handcuff\\'d to him\\n    and walk by his side,\\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\\n    on my twitching lips.)\\n\\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\\n    and sentenced.\\n\\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\\nMy face is ash-color\\'d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\\n\\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\\n\\n     38\\nEnough! enough! enough!\\nSomehow I have been stunn\\'d. Stand back!\\nGive me a little time beyond my cuff\\'d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\\nI discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\\n\\nThat I could forget the mockers and insults!\\nThat I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\\n    bludgeons and hammers!\\nThat I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\\n    bloody crowning.\\n\\nI remember now,\\nI resume the overstaid fraction,\\nThe grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\\nCorpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\\n\\nI troop forth replenish\\'d with supreme power, one of an average\\n    unending procession,\\nInland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\\nOur swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\\nThe blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\\n\\nEleves, I salute you! come forward!\\nContinue your annotations, continue your questionings.\\n\\n     39\\nThe friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\\nIs he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\\n\\nIs he some Southwesterner rais\\'d out-doors? is he Kanadian?\\nIs he from the Mississippi country?

lovers,\\nDeath or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,\\n(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)\\nIndeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as\\n    you mean,\\nGrow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my breast!\\nSpring away from the conceal\\'d heart there!\\nDo not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!\\nDo not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!\\nCome I am determin\\'d to unbare this broad breast of mine, I have\\n    long enough stifled and choked;\\nEmblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me not,\\nI will say what I have to say by itself,\\nI will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a\\n    call only their call,\\nI will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,\\nI will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will\\n    through the States,\\nThrough me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,\\nGive me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,\\nGive me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, and\\n    are folded inseparably together, you love and death are,\\nNor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,\\nFor now it is convey\\'d to me that you are the purports essential,\\nThat you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that\\n    they are mainly for you,\\nThat you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,\\nThat behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how long,\\nThat you will one day perhaps take control of all,\\nThat you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,\\nThat may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long,\\nBut you will last very long.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand\\n\\nWhoever you are holding me now in hand,\\nWithout one thing all will be useless,\\nI give you fair warning before you attempt me further,\\nI am not what you supposed, but far different.\\n\\nWho is he that would become my follower?\\nWho would sign himself a candidate for my affections?\\n\\nThe way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,\\nYou would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your\\n    sole and exclusive standard,\\nYour novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,\\nThe whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives\\n    around you would have to be abandon\\'d,\\nTherefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let\\n    go your hand from my shoulders,\\nPut me down and depart on your way.\\n\\nOr else by stealth in some wood for trial,\\nOr back of a rock in the open air,\\n(For in any roof\\'d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,\\nAnd in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)\\nBut just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any\\n    person for miles around approach unawares,\\nOr possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or\\n    some quiet island,\\nHere to put your lips upon mine I permit you,\\nWith the comrade\\'s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband\\'s kiss,\\nFor I am the new husband and I am the comrade.\\n\\nOr if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,\\nWhere I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,\\nCarry me when you go forth over land or sea;\\nFor thus merely touching you is enough, is best,\\nAnd thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.\\n\\nBut these leaves conning you con at peril,\\nFor these leaves and me you will not understand,\\nThey will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will\\n    certainly elude you.\\nEven while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!\\nAlready you see I have escaped from you.\\n\\nFor it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,\\nNor is it by reading it you will acquire it,\\nNor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,\\nNor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few)\\n    prove victorious,\\nNor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil,\\n    perhaps more,\\nFor all is useless without that which you may guess at many times\\n    and not hit, that which I hinted at;\\nTherefore release me and depart on your way.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  For You, O Democracy\\n\\nCome, I will make the continent indissoluble,\\nI will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon,\\nI will make

accumulated,\\n(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and\\n    partly cover them, beyond these I pass,)\\nFar, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I\\n    think where I go,\\nSolitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence,\\nAlone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,\\nSome walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,\\nThey the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come, a\\n    great crowd, and I in the middle,\\nCollecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,\\nPlucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me,\\nHere, lilac, with a branch of pine,\\nHere, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull\\'d off a live-oak in\\n    Florida as it hung trailing down,\\nHere, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,\\nAnd here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,\\n(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again\\n    never to separate from me,\\nAnd this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this\\n    calamus-root shall,\\nInterchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)\\nAnd twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,\\nAnd stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,\\nThese I compass\\'d around by a thick cloud of spirits,\\nWandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,\\nIndicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to each;\\nBut what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,\\nI will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable\\n    of loving.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Not Heaving from My Ribb\\'d Breast Only\\n\\nNot heaving from my

them,)\\nMay-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem)\\n    as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they\\n    would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely\\n    changed points of view;\\nTo me these and the like of these are curiously answer\\'d by my\\n    lovers, my dear friends,\\nWhen he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me\\n    by the hand,\\nWhen the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason\\n    hold not, surround us and pervade us,\\nThen I am charged with untold and

over the beach, and undressing bathed,\\n    laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,\\nAnd when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way\\n    coming, O then I was happy,\\nO then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food\\n    nourish\\'d me more, and the beautiful day pass\\'d well,\\nAnd the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came\\n    my friend,\\nAnd that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly\\n    continually up the shores,\\nI heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me\\n    whispering to congratulate me,\\nFor the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in\\n    the cool night,\\nIn the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,\\nAnd his arm

   1\\nAfoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,\\nHealthy, free, the world before me,\\nThe long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\\n\\nHenceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,\\nHenceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,\\nDone with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,\\nStrong and content I travel the open road.\\n\\nThe earth, that is sufficient,\\nI do not want the constellations any nearer,\\nI know they are very well where they are,\\nI know they suffice for those who belong to them.\\n\\n(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,\\nI carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,\\nI swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,\\nI am fill\\'d with them, and I will fill them in return.)\\n\\n     2\\nYou road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all\\n    that is here,\\nI believe that much unseen is also here.\\n\\nHere the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,\\nThe black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas\\'d, the\\n    illiterate person, are not denied;\\nThe birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar\\'s tramp, the\\n    drunkard\\'s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,\\nThe escaped youth, the rich person\\'s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,\\nThe early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the\\n    town, the return back from the town,\\nThey pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,\\nNone but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.\\n\\n     3\\nYou air that serves me with breath to speak!\\nYou objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\\nYou light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!\\nYou paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!\\nI believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me.\\n\\nYou flagg\\'d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!\\nYou ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\\n    side! you distant ships!\\nYou rows of houses! you window-pierc\\'d facades! you roofs!\\nYou porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\\nYou windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\\nYou doors and ascending steps! you arches!\\nYou gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\\nFrom all that has touch\\'d you I believe you have imparted to\\n    yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,\\nFrom the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,\\n    and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\\n\\n     4\\nThe earth expanding right hand and left hand,\\nThe picture alive, every part in its best

you say to me Do not leave me?\\nDo you say Venture not--if you leave me you are lost?\\nDo you say I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied,\\n    adhere to me?\\n\\nO public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,\\nYou express me better than I can express myself,\\nYou shall be more to me than my poem.\\n\\nI think heroic deeds were all conceiv\\'d in the open

whoever I see must be happy.\\n\\n     5\\nFrom this hour I ordain myself loos\\'d of limits and imaginary lines,\\nGoing where I list, my own master total and absolute,\\nListening to others, considering well what they say,\\nPausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,\\nGently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that\\n    would hold me.\\n\\nI inhale great draughts of space,\\nThe east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.\\n\\nI am larger, better than I thought,\\nI did not know I held so much goodness.\\n\\nAll seems beautiful to me,\\ncan repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me\\n    I would do the same to you,\\nI will recruit for myself and you as I go,\\nI will scatter myself among men and women as I go,\\nI will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,\\nWhoever denies me it shall not trouble me,\\nWhoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.\\n\\n     6\\nNow if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,\\nNow if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear\\'d it would not\\n    astonish me.\\n\\nNow I see the secret of the making of the best persons,\\nIt is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.\\n\\nHere a great personal deed has room,\\n(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,\\nIts effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all\\n    authority and all argument against it.)\\n\\nHere is the test of wisdom,\\nWisdom is not finally tested in schools,\\nWisdom cannot be pass\\'d from one having it to another not having it,\\nWisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,\\nApplies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,\\nIs the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the\\n    excellence of things;\\nSomething there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\\n    it out of the soul.\\n\\nNow I re-examine philosophies and religions,\\nThey may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the\\n    spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\\n\\nHere is realization,\\nHere is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,\\nThe past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you\\n    are vacant of them.\\n\\nOnly the kernel of every object nourishes;\\nWhere is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\\nWhere is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\\n\\nHere is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion\\'d, it is apropos;\\nDo you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\\nDo you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\\n\\n     7\\nHere is the efflux of the soul,\\nThe efflux of the soul comes from within through embower\\'d gates,\\n    ever provoking questions,\\nThese yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\\nWhy are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\\n    expands my blood?\\nWhy when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\\nWhy are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\\n    thoughts descend upon me?\\n(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\\n    drop fruit as I pass;)\\nWhat is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\\nWhat with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\\nWhat with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\\n    and pause?\\nWhat gives me to be free to a woman\\'s and man\\'s good-will? what\\n    gives them to be free to mine?\\n\\n     8\\nThe efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,\\nI think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,\\nNow it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.\\n\\nHere rises the fluid and attaching character,\\nThe fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of\\n    man and woman,\\n(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day\\n    out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet\\n    continually out of itself.)\\n\\nToward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the\\n    love of young and old,\\nFrom it falls distill\\'d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,\\nToward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.\\n\\n     9\\nAllons! whoever you are come travel with me!\\nTraveling with me you find what never tires.\\n\\nThe earth never tires,\\nThe earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude\\n    and incomprehensible at first,\\nBe not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop\\'d,\\nI swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.\\n\\nAllons! we must not stop here,\\nHowever sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling\\n    we cannot remain here,\\nHowever shelter\\'d this port and however calm these waters we must\\n    not anchor here,\\nHowever welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted\\n    to receive it but a little while.\\n\\n     10\\nAllons! the inducements shall be greater,\\nWe will sail pathless and wild seas,\\nWe will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper\\n    speeds by under full sail.\\n\\nAllons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,\\nHealth, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;\\nAllons! from all formules!\\nFrom your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests.\\n\\nThe stale cadaver blocks up the passage--the burial waits no longer.\\n\\nAllons! yet take warning!\\nHe traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,\\nNone may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health,\\nCome not here if you have already spent the

to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.\\n\\n     2\\nThe impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,\\nThe simple, compact, well-join\\'d scheme, myself

the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\\nThe current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\\nThe others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\\nThe certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.\\n\\nOthers will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\\nOthers will watch the run of the flood-tide,\\nOthers will see the

into the night,\\nCasting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow\\n    light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.\\n\\n     4\\nThese and all else were to me the same as they are to you,\\nI loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,\\nThe men and women I saw were all near to me,\\nOthers the same--others who look back on me

arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of\\n    their flesh against me as I sat,\\nSaw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet\\n    never told them a word,\\nLived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\\nPlay\\'d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\\nThe same old role, the role that is what we

looking upon you;\\nBe firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet\\n    haste with the hasting current;\\nFly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the

one\\'s head, in the sunlit water!\\nCome on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail\\'d\\n    schooners, sloops, lighters!\\nFlaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower\\'d at sunset!\\nBurn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at\\n    nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!\\nAppearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you

signs. And I stand before the young man\\n    face to face, and take his right hand in my left hand and his\\n    left hand in my right hand,\\nAnd I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him that\\n    answers for all, and send these signs.\\n\\nHim all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,\\nHim they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light,\\nHim they immerse and he immerses them.\\n\\nBeautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,\\n    people, animals,\\nThe profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so\\n    tell I my morning\\'s romanza,)\\nAll enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money will buy,\\nThe best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,\\nThe noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he\\n    domiciles there,\\nNothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,\\n    the ships in the offing,\\nThe perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody.\\n\\nHe puts things in their attitudes,\\nHe puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,\\nHe places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and\\n    sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest\\n    never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.\\n\\nHe is the Answerer,\\nWhat can be answer\\'d he answers, and what cannot be answer\\'d he\\n    shows how it cannot be answer\\'d.\\n\\nA man is a summons and challenge,\\n(It is vain to skulk--do you hear that mocking and laughter? do you\\n    hear the ironical echoes?)\\n\\nBooks, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,\\n    beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,\\nHe indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and\\n    down also.\\n\\nWhichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly\\n    and gently and safely by day or by night,\\nHe has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the prying of\\n    hands on the knobs.\\n\\nHis welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome or\\n    universal than he is,\\nThe person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.\\n\\nEvery existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,\\nHe resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and\\n    any man translates, and any man translates himself also,\\nOne part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees\\n    how they join.\\n\\nHe says indifferently and alike How are you friend? to the President\\n    at his levee,\\nAnd he says Good-day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,\\nAnd both understand him and know that his speech is right.\\n\\nHe walks with perfect ease in the capitol,\\nHe walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,\\n    Here is our equal appearing and new.\\n\\nThen the mechanics take him for a mechanic,\\nAnd the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that\\n    he has follow\\'d the sea,\\nAnd the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\\nAnd the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,\\nNo matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has\\n    follow\\'d it,\\nNo matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and\\n    sisters there.\\n\\nThe English believe he comes of their English stock,\\nA Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near,\\n    removed from none.\\n\\nWhoever he looks at in the traveler\\'s coffee-house claims him,\\nThe Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard\\n    is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,\\nThe engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi\\n    or St. Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Paumanok sound, claims him.\\n\\nThe gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,\\nThe insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see\\n    themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,\\nThey are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are so grown.\\n\\n

dark,\\nThe maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\\nHis insight and power encircle things and the human race,\\nHe is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.\\n\\nThe singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,\\nThe singers are welcom\\'d, understood, appear often enough, but rare\\n    has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker\\n    of poems, the Answerer,\\n(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain\\'d such a\\n    day, for all its names.)\\n\\nThe singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible\\n    names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,\\nThe name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,\\n    sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer,\\n    weird-singer, or something else.\\n\\nAll this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,\\nThe words of true poems do not merely please,\\nThe true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;\\nThe greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers\\n    and fathers,\\nThe words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\\n\\nDivine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,\\n    rudeness of body, withdrawnness,\\nGayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems.\\n\\nThe sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,\\nThe builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all\\n    these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.\\n\\nThe words of the true poems give you more than poems,\\nThey give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,\\n    peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,\\nThey balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,\\nThey do not seek beauty, they are sought,\\nForever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,\\n    fain, love-sick.\\n\\nThey prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\\nThey bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,\\nWhom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to\\n    learn one of the meanings,\\nTo launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless\\n    rings and never be quiet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n[BOOK X]\\n\\n}  Our Old Feuillage\\n\\nAlways our

with tall shapes dingily seen,\\nThe numerous camp-fires scatter\\'d near and far, some away up on the\\n    mountain,\\nThe shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,\\nAnd over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,\\n    breaking out, the eternal stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  An Army Corps on the March\\n\\nWith its cloud of skirmishers in advance,\\nWith now the

wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,\\nSickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,\\nBy the jamb of a door leans.\\n\\nGrieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks

bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)\\nI stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster\\'s face is white as a lily,)\\nThen before I depart I sweep my eyes o\\'er the scene fain to absorb it

O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill\\'d,\\nSome on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the\\n    death-spasm sweating,\\nAn occasional scream or cry, the doctor\\'s shouted orders or calls,\\nThe glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of\\n    the torches,\\nThese I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,\\nThen hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;\\nBut first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,\\nThen the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,\\nResuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,\\nThe unknown road still marching.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim\\n\\nA sight in camp in the
