      "The Wall Street Journal Online</br></br>The Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here.</br></br>On Friday evening, with Congress out of town on its summer recess and Americans heading into a mid-August weekend, the Bush administration sent a message to the states: The federal government will make it tougher for a national children's insurance program to cover the offspring of middle-income families.</br></br>The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid, and administration officials tell the New York Times that the changes are aimed at returning the program to its low- income focus and assuring it didn't become a replacement for private insurance. Administration point man Dennis Smith wrote to state officials saying there would be new restrictions on the District of Columbia and the 18 states -- including California and New York -- that extend or plan to extend coverage for children whose families make more than 250% of Federal poverty levels. For a family of three that 250% is $42,900, and for a family of four it's $51,625. Under the new limits, a child from a family making more would have to spend one year uninsured before qualifying, and any state that wants to extend coverage would have to assure Washington that at least 95% of children eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid are enrolled in one of the programs. But as the Associated Press reports, no state can currently make such assurances.</br></br>Rachel Klein, deputy director of health policy for advocacy group Families USA, tells the AP that since many families above the 250% threshold can't afford private insurance, \"the effect of this policy is to have more uninsured kids.\" Ann Clemency Kohler, deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey, tells the Times the changes \"will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children.\" States have already been imposing waiting periods and taking other steps to prevent parents from moving their children from private insurance to SCHIP, which currently serves some 6.6 million children, the Washington Post notes. The administration's new restrictions come as the program, which expires at the end of next month if Congress doesn't reauthorize it, is the subject of a larger political fight that pits the White House against Democrats and some Republicans in Congress and state capitals.\n",
      "J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. reached a tentative deal this weekend to pay $13 billion to end a number of civil investigations into its sale of mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, but a separate and potentially more serious criminal probe into the bank and its executives will continue.</br></br>The Justice Department, convinced it has strong evidence related to the bank's conduct and eager to send a message to Wall Street, rebuffed repeated attempts by J.P. Morgan to settle the criminal investigation without admitting wrongdoing and agreed only to resolve the civil investigations. It also threatened last Thursday to file its civil case this coming Wednesday if the two sides can't reach a final deal, said people close to the talks.</br></br>The proposed pact includes $4 billion to settle claims by the Federal Housing Finance Agency that J.P. Morgan misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of the mortgage securities it sold them, another $4 billion in consumer relief, and $5 billion in penalties paid by the bank, according to people familiar with the deal. But the two sides remain apart on several issues related to the civil settlement, including whether the bank should have to admit that it didn't follow its own due-diligence standards in packaging the mortgages into securities it could sell, according to people familiar with the discussions.</br></br>The talks come as the bank faces an uphill battle in Washington. Once a favorite in the capital, J.P. Morgan now is grappling with a bruised reputation and fractured relationship with regulators in the wake of the \"London whale\" trading fiasco out of the bank's U.K. headquarters. The trades, which lost the bank $6.5 billion, transformed J.P. Morgan from an institution that seemingly could do no wrong to one under heavy and unyielding scrutiny.</br></br>When top bankers assembled at the White House in early October, J.P. Morgan's James Dimon found his name card on a seat in the corner, far from his usual perch across from President Barack Obama. Mr. Dimon, who in previous gatherings had been quick to share his opinions with the president, was reserved and said little during the meeting, according to people who attended. Other chief executives saw his placement as a symbolic shift.\n",
      "Five large banks reported improved second-quarter profits, fueled in large part by increases in net interest income as interest rates fell.</br></br>Profits at SunTrust Banks Inc., Wachovia Corp., First Fidelity Bancorp., KeyCorp and NBD Bancorp Inc. exceeded most analysts' estimates. The results continued what is proving to be a strong quarter for most regional banks. SunTrust, Wachovia, First Fidelity and KeyCorp also saw improvements in credit quality, while NBD saw a slight deterioration.</br></br>\"Most banks are reporting higher net interest margins while keeping their expenses under control,\" said Richard Stillinger, a senior vice president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York.</br></br>In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, SunTrust shares were quoted at $42.25, up $1.50; Wachovia at $64.50, down 50 cents; First Fidelity at $38.25, down 75 cents; KeyCorp at $34.50, down 25 cents; and NBD at $29.25, up 12.5 cents.</br></br>SunTrust\n",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- George Bush played down the need for any \"radical steps\" to cut the $155 billion federal budget deficit after the election, arguing that \"steady control, steady restraint\" will correct it.</br></br>The Republican presidential nominee insisted he considers deficit reduction important, but his steady-as-you-go prescription suggests he would attach less urgency to assembling any big deficit-reduction package than some lawmakers and business executives would. He suggested that short-term worries about the deficit will be eased as long as the economy is growing and pushing up government revenues.</br></br>\"The larger the {economic growth}, the more reasonable it is to stay with projected reduction targets\" for the federal deficit, Mr. Bush said in an interview. \"In other words, if you're making a lot of money you can owe a little more money.\"</br></br>Mr. Bush was dismissive of the National Economic Commission, a bipartisan panel that is studying ways to attack the deficit. Many business and political leaders see the commission as providing the political cover necessary for a new president to deal effectively with the deficit problem. But many conservatives worry that commission members will recommend a tax boost as part of a deficit-cutting package.</br></br>\"My message to them is very simple: I'm delighted you were willing to make some suggestions but listen to the American people,\" Mr. Bush said. Commission members \"are not elected, and congressmen are and a president is.\"\n"

      "It's no secret that the tea party faithful regard the Obama administration as a Constitution-shredding tyranny. But in a profile of the movement published last week, the New York Times reported the surprising news that many of the protesters have come to this view as a result of their experiences in the recession: \"Their families upended by lost jobs, foreclosed homes and depleted retirement funds, they said they wanted to know why it happened and whom to blame.\"</br></br>An account of a conservative uprising published a few days later by the Washington Post under the headline, \"Appalachia is slipping from grip of Democrats,\" told the story of a hard-bitten congressional district in western Virginia where the response to the recession has been a dramatic swerve to the right.</br></br>The free-market system blunders into recession; its victims flock to the free-market banner. And here we go again.</br></br>The backlash against liberalism has been going on for more than 40 years. It is as immediate as this morning's newspaper but as old as those \"Silent Majority\" buttons you find at antique stores. Since the days of George Wallace, conservatives have been leading rebellions against hippies, against busing, against Hollywood, against property taxes, against welfare, against evolution, against whatever.</br></br>The formula is familiar beyond the point of tedium: Middle-American righteousness, resentment of liberal \"elites,\" weepy fantasies of persecution set to a country-music melody. Yet its power never wears off. Today conservatives are giddily anticipating another electoral disaster for the \"Party of the People.\"\n",
      "AMSTERDAM--Dutch retailer Royal Ahold NV said Wednesday that first quarter net profit fell 97% as last year's results were boosted by a large gain, and that it expects volumes to remain under pressure during the second quarter.</br></br>First quarter net profit was [euro]50 million ($68.2 million) compared with [euro]1.95 billion a year earlier, when it booked a [euro]1.75 billion gain from the sale of its stake in Swedish retailer ICA.</br></br>In the first quarter Ahold set aside a [euro]177 million provision to settle a class-action lawsuit related to improper accounting practices at its former subsidiary, U.S. Foodservice.</br></br>First-quarter sales were down 2.5% at [euro]9.82 billion from [euro]10.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of currency losses, sales were up 0.3%.</br></br>\"First-quarter sales trends were similar to the previous quarter with a flat year-on-year performance, impacted by low inflation and volumes that remained under pressure in all our markets,\" Chief Executive Dick Boer said. Ahold, which generates around 60% of its sales in the U.S., said it expects trading conditions in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter.\n",
      "Behind every good rally these days is a good deal of shadow-market trading.</br></br>Stocks again surged to new highs Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 23.97 points to a record 1535.21, the fourth record close last week. The broader market indexes also set new highs. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 177.9 million, the sixth highest ever.</br></br>Analysts note that all that trading isn't coming from investors just buying stocks on economic fundamentals. A lot of the activity, they say, is professional trading connected to the options and futures markets. Such intermarket trading, particularly as it involves covering short positions in the stock market, may be helping to sustain the rally, some analysts say.</br></br>The New York Stock Exchange estimates 30% of its volume lately has been connected to options or futures markets in some way. That estimate encompasses a plethora of trading strategies involving options on individual stocks and options and futures on stock indexes.</br></br>Connected trading in the shadow markets is \"probably at a high point,\" says Donald Solodar, head of market surveillance at the Big Board. With equity options, a call offers the right to buy -- and a put offers the right to sell -- 100 shares of a stock at a set price during a fixed time. Options and futures on stock indexes allow investors to speculate or hedge on the direction of the entire market.\n",
      "South Korea's efforts to engineer an economic recovery received a shot in the arm yesterday when global investors turned out in droves to participate in the country's landmark $4 billion bond sale.</br></br>In addition to paving the way for more South Korean corporate bonds, the sale is expected to set the stage for billions of dollars in Asian bonds in the months ahead.</br></br>Searching for high-yielding bonds in an age of near-record-low bond yields, investors from around the globe showed strong demand for yesterday's two-part deal. Seoul sold $1 billion of five-year notes at a yield of 8.953%, or 3.45 percentage points above comparable U.S. Treasurys. Some $3 billion of 10-year securities were sold at a yield of 9.084%, or 3.55 percentage points above Treasurys.</br></br>Seoul was able to sell the bonds at a yield just below the level expected several days ago, underscoring strong demand for the bonds despite last week's downgrade of Japan's debt outlook by Moody's Investors Service Inc.</br></br>The bond sale was underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc.\n",
      "PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. -- The rise of conservative \"tea party\" activists around the country has created a dilemma for Republicans. They are breathing life into the party's quest to regain power. But they're also waging war on some candidates hand-picked by GOP leaders as the most likely to win.</br></br>In upstate New York, Dede Scozzafava, 49 years old, is the choice of local party leaders to defend a Republican seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, an abortion-rights candidate who could appeal to independents. Doug Hoffman, 59, is a local accountant backed by tea-party activists who has jumped into the race declaring himself the real conservative.</br></br>Mr. Hoffman has siphoned so much support from Ms. Scozzafava that their Democratic rival has vaulted into the lead, according to a poll released Thursday. The election is Nov. 3.</br></br>\"I am not your run-of-the-mill politician, and maybe that's why the Republican bosses didn't like me,\" Mr. Hoffman told a recent health-care forum sponsored by the Upstate New York Tea Party. In an interview, Ms. Scozzafava acknowledged her discomfort at the event. \"I knew it wasn't going to be an easy audience for me,\" she said.</br></br>Republicans are poised to pick up a number of seats in next year's congressional elections, pollsters estimate, on the back of a deep recession, public unease about the growth of government and the size of the nation's deficit. Anti-Obama activism manifested in rallies and town-hall meetings has galvanized conservatives, injecting enthusiasm into the Republican base.\n",
