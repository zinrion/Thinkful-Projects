       "'J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. reached a tentative deal this weekend to pay $13 billion to end a number of civil investigations into its sale of mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis, but a separate and potentially more serious criminal probe into the bank and its executives will continue.</br></br>The Justice Department, convinced it has strong evidence related to the bank\\'s conduct and eager to send a message to Wall Street, rebuffed repeated attempts by J.P. Morgan to settle the criminal investigation without admitting wrongdoing and agreed only to resolve the civil investigations. It also threatened last Thursday to file its civil case this coming Wednesday if the two sides can\\'t reach a final deal, said people close to the talks.</br></br>The proposed pact includes $4 billion to settle claims by the Federal Housing Finance Agency that J.P. Morgan misled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of the mortgage securities it sold them, another $4 billion in consumer relief, and $5 billion in penalties paid by the bank, according to people familiar with the deal. But the two sides remain apart on several issues related to the civil settlement, including whether the bank should have to admit that it didn\\'t follow its own due-diligence standards in packaging the mortgages into securities it could sell, according to people familiar with the discussions.</br></br>The talks come as the bank faces an uphill battle in Washington. Once a favorite in the capital, J.P. Morgan now is grappling with a bruised reputation and fractured relationship with regulators in the wake of the \"London whale\" trading fiasco out of the bank\\'s U.K. headquarters. The trades, which lost the bank $6.5 billion, transformed J.P. Morgan from an institution that seemingly could do no wrong to one under heavy and unyielding scrutiny.</br></br>When top bankers assembled at the White House in early October, J.P. Morgan\\'s James Dimon found his name card on a seat in the corner, far from his usual perch across from President Barack Obama. Mr. Dimon, who in previous gatherings had been quick to share his opinions with the president, was reserved and said little during the meeting, according to people who attended. Other chief executives saw his placement as a symbolic shift.'"

He is getting good care and gets along well with the staff.</br></br>Nigh is 20 years old, a 2002 graduate of Falls Church High School. He is also a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy. With no programs available to help Nigh after graduation, his father, a single parent, felt he had little choice but to put his son in a nursing home that accepts Medicaid patients. Sam Nigh, 54, who was recently laid off from his job at an insurance company, said he hopes that some alternative will come through next year.</br></br>\"They\\'re doing a good job taking care of me,\" Ted Nigh said of the 180-bed nursing home in Manassas where he has lived since May. But his stay \"is becoming too long,\" he added. \"You just get aggravated. . . . I don\\'t want nursing home life to become a regular habit.\"</br></br>Like all states, Virginia is required by federal law to provide special education to disabled students such as Nigh. But increasingly, advocates say, the millions of dollars spent on this education are going to waste as budget cuts whittle down the programs that allow special education graduates to transition to jobs and more independent lives. This creates added burdens for parents, who sometimes must sacrifice their own jobs to stay home and care for their disabled children.</br></br>\"Recent budget crunches and tax cuts have further stressed a system that is already very inadequate,\" said Kathy May, lead advocate for The Arc of Northern Virginia, a local affiliate of the national advocacy group The Arc, which promotes the rights of people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities.'"

It added that if the situation continues, it will have to file for bankruptcy protection.</br></br>Some Wall Street analysts have been predicting since last fall that Flyi may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. The airline has raised the possibility, too, but never with the sense of urgency it demonstrated yesterday.</br></br>In a mid-afternoon conference call with Wall Street analysts before the quarterly report was filed, Flyi chief executive Kerry B. Skeen didn\\'t mention bankruptcy. But he raised serious concerns about the company\\'s future and outlined steps to address its liquidity crisis.</br></br>Skeen said his 14-month-old airline plans, for example, to reduce the number of flights it offers by 17 percent this fall, eliminate service to San Jose, Calif., borrow more money, sell off some assets, delay the purchase of future aircraft and ask creditors to forgive or restructure more debt.'"
