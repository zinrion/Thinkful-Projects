      "Although President Reagan said Thursday that he opposes extending special unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless because retraining is a better solution, he has asked Congress to rescind $119 million of the $222 million it had -approved for retraining dislocated ÐÊworkers in 1985.Office of Management and Budget spokesman Edwin L. Dale Jr. said yesterday that the full amount is not needed because money is left l over since the states werent able to use it effectively. But Jim Ellen-berger of the AFL-CIO's unemployment insurance department called the presidents position hypocritical.At his news conference Thursday night, the president was asked Û¢whether he supported legislation to extend a program that would provide up to 14 weeks of additional unemployment benefits to 325,000 workers who have exhausted their regular state benefits.300,000 new jobs a month and in part because he believes the place \"for people who are having problems is our job-training program directed at those who have to be relocated because something has happened to the industries they formerly worked in.Reagan was referring to the Job Training and Partnership Act of 1982, which provides special retraining to workers who lose jobs because their employer has gone out of business, moved away or permanently cut its labor force. Congress approved $222 million for the program for 1985, about the same level as in 1984. The program is in addition to a much larger program designed to train low-income persons, particularly young people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.475768\n",
      "STOCKS LOST momentum and ended the day lower on light trading volume, as a dearth of economic news left investors to fret over high oil prices, persistently high Treasury yields and the robust price of gold and other commodities.Stocks kicked off the day higher to extend Monday's gains, with an initial boost from strong earnings of aluminum-maker Alcoa and mobile- phone firm Nokia. But share prices soon turned south as investors worried about inflation, particularly in commodities. Signs of inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, which can cool enthusiasm for stocks as investors seek higher yields from bonds.Renewed concern about a possible slowdown in consumer spending and corporate earnings growth as a result of higher rates pushed down the Dow Jones Industrial Average 51.70 points, or 0.46%, to 11089.63 points, or up 3.5% this year.Crude-oil futures settled up 24 cents at $68.98 a barrel, after climbing to a seven-month high of $69.45 Monday night. Oil is up 13% this year.

      "I would like to thank Messrs. Culver, Scott and Hawn (Letters to the Editor, Nov. 10) for the opportunity to correct several of their common misunderstandings about fuel grade ethanol.Dave Culver, in his concern over the projected production cost of ethanol, makes no mention of the true costs of imported oil. When externalities such as environmental and health costs, the loss of domestic jobs and basic industries, the trade deficit, commitments of military resources to ensure the free flow of oil from the Middle East and threats to our energy and national security are included, the true cost of imports even now exceeds $100/bbl, according to the General Accounting Office.Mr. Culver is off by a factor of almost 10 in his claim that \"Vehicles that consume a 10% mixture of `gasohol' typically see a 20% loss in fuel mileage.\" Between 2% and 4% is correct. He is a bit closer in his description of E-85 vehicles. At this time, they experience about a 20% reduction in range compared to gasoline. That will improve with higher compression ratio engines allowed by ethanol's 113 octane. He is just flat wrong about fires and fuel system incompatibility with ethanol.John W. Scott is correct in warning that the production of ethanol and other biofuels from feed grains and oilseeds, from agriculture and forestry residues, fast growing trees and grasses and well as from urban biomass heading for the dump, must ensure environmental integrity from the dirt to the tailpipe. The sloshing down the river of 15 gallons of top soil for every gallon of ethanol simply does not occur with modern, environmentally sound farming practices including crop rotation, conservation tillage, planting and harvesting, filter strips and the scientific use of agricultural chemicals. As the nation commercializes the conversion of ethanol and other biofuels from cellulosic biomass, the planting of grasses and trees on erodible land will bring increasing levels of top soil to farm lands, a process already well under way.Richard G. Hawn needs to visit Brazil to verify his claims of poor-running cars and double-the-size gas tanks. Essentially all cars in Brazil run on ethanol, either in blends of 22% ethanol/78% gasoline or 99% ethanol (a little touch of denaturant to keep the imbibers away). They run well and the public is pleased. The fuel tanks are about 20% larger than they would be if straight gasoline were used. He is right about the Btu content of ethanol being lower than gasoline  76,000 Btu compared with about 119,000 for gasoline. But he neglected to mention that the increased thermal efficiency of ethanol when combusted and its much higher octane permits engine designs that will almost remove the Btu advantage of gasoline. He also failed to mention that air quality in San Paulo Brazil, with a population of 14 million, is better than in Los Angeles, New York City or Houston Texas. There are, of course, \"externalities\" in this observation  and I will show mine when the oil companies show theirs.    0.452302\n",
      "GENERAL MOTORS POSTED a 49% drop in third-quarter profit and a $338.5 million operating loss, confirming expectations. The results reflected sharply higher costs, especially from recent sales incentives. GM also announced further cost-cutting steps, including the closing of several factories in the U.S.OPEC ministers argued about the effect of their temporary production agreement even as they left their Geneva meeting. Oil prices tumbled as world markets showed little confidence in the accord.Reagan signed the tax bill, calling it \"an historic overhaul.\" The president warned Congress to refrain from changing the law next year, saying he would oppose attempts to boost tax rates to shrink the budget deficit.Two securities firms rushed to market stripped municipal bonds, which became legal under the new tax law.

      "CHICAGO  Bank One Corp., whose credit-card business has been hurt by rising interest rates, warned investors that first-quarter profit would likely fall shy of analysts' projections.A First Call/Thomson Financial poll of 14 analysts showed a median estimate of 65 cents a diluted share, with a range of 62 cents to 69 cents. \"We would expect and encourage the consensus to settle at the 60-cent level,\" said Bank One's president and acting chief executive, Verne Istock.With about 1.1 billion diluted shares outstanding, 60 cents would equal about $660 million of net income for the quarter ending March 31. A year ago, the banking concern posted net of $1.15 billion, or 88 cents a share.The disclosure sent Bank One shares down $1.1875, or 4.5%, to $25 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4 p.m. Friday.Mr. Istock said the first quarter would be the year's weakest. Rates that banks pay for deposits and other funds they lend have risen in recent months.

      "Michael Mierzewski, a Washington lawyer, noticed last spring that the room rate at the Big Sur resort he and his wife, Kathy, were visiting was down from previous years. He couldn't help noticing the freebies. The Ventana Inn & Spa (currently $410 to $1,077 per night for a double) was offering a daily free spa session. His choice, a massage.\"I suspect once the economy picks up and people are less afraid to travel, that we'll go back to more normal pricing of hotel rooms, and the free amenities will become less available than they are now,\" Mierzewski, 51, said recently.But some hotels may be hoping for guests who don't notice everything, such as amenities that have disappeared. At some Ritz- Carlton hotels, the \"bath butler\"  who draws a guest's bath and sprinkles aromatic oils or a few flower petals into it  is gone from the menu of services. For the luxury chain, it's not a \"must- have.\" \"In order to save people's jobs in the last few months, we had to temporarily discontinue things in a few hotels,\" company spokeswoman Vivian A. Deuschl said. \"And it is a temporary thing.\"It can be no surprise to anyone who pays attention to the news that travel and tourism have yet to recover from a two-year triple whammy of recession, terrorism and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Airlines are going belly-up, and hotels and resorts the world over are complaining about low occupancy rates. Most hotels or resorts with more than 100 rooms are aiming for the meeting and convention business, industry officials say, but the business traveler seems to have fallen off a cliff back in 1998 and has yet to reappear on the scene.The uncertainty of the world tourism market has sent luxury hoteliers off in various directions looking for the right formula that will let them attract customers but also stay healthy financially. Some are offering package deals they once never contemplated. Others are concentrating on the important amenities while cutting back the nonessential. When resorts feel squeezed, says John S. Fareed, director of the consulting firm Resort Marketing Partners, fresh-cut flowers, free newspapers, shoeshine mitts and brand-name shampoos disappear. Even towels in the room may be less plentiful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.440577\n",
      "I don't own a single share of Shawmut National Corp., but I made $1,700 in two days last week because Shawmut was gobbled up in a merger. How did I make money on a stock I've never owned? Easy. One of my biggest investments, Comerica Inc., was picked to take Shawmut's place in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and indexers began buying truckloads of Comerica shares. That produced a windfall for those of us who owned the stock.Welcome to the wonderful world of indexing. S&P announced last Tuesday evening that Comerica was joining the S&P 500. Comerica officially joined the index when the stock market closed on Thursday. By then, its stock had risen $2.12 1/2, a nice 6 percent jump from its Tuesday close. My 800 Comerica shares  the biggest single holding in my retirement accounts  were thus worth $1,700 more than they were two days earlier. In all, Comerica's shares gained about a quarter-billion dollars in market value.Had Comerica's prospects improved? Were its profits higher? Had some divine power alleviated the problems wracking Detroit, Comerica's hometown and biggest single market?Nope. By all accounts, the two-day increase stems entirely from Comerica becoming part of the index. That forced index funds and other investors with portfolios tied to the S&P 500 to buy Comerica. All these new buyers  a total of 6.3 million shares changed hands Wednesday and Thursday, more than 15 times Comerica's normal daily trading volume  levitated the stock. From now on, Comerica stock will be about $2 higher than it would be without the indexers. So I'm ahead even though I haven't sold my shares.I'm not telling you this tale to brag it's not as if I knew Comerica would go on the S&P 500. Rather, I want to discuss how Comerica  pronounced Koh-MEH-rikka  is a teeny-tiny example of how index investors can distort the prices of individual stocks. And how the S&P 500, the benchmark by which most professional investors judge their performance, is becoming distorted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.439404\n",
      "WASHINGTON  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the U.S. will emphasize the urgency of reviving the global economy at next week's summit in Tokyo, and predicted that Germany will cut interest rates again to that end.\"You've seen . . . the consensus across Europe that rates should be lowered. Frankly, I think they'll be lowered some more,\" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview. The German Bundesbank's policy makers meet today, but Mr. Bentsen wouldn't say if he expects an interest-rate cut that soon. Asked if the U.S. will press the Japanese at the summit to do more to stimulate its economy, the secretary replied: \"I've never stopped asking.\"Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who will meet with the G-7 leaders next week, will come away with far more than his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, got at the London summit two years ago, Mr. Bentsen said. For instance, U.S. officials say the G-7 has agreed to open an office in Moscowo coordinate aid.And yesterday, the directors of the International Monetary Fund, as expected, approved a $1.5 billion loan for Russia, the first under a new fund created at the urging of the G-7 to assist Russia and other formerly Communist countries.Unable to make as much progress as they had hoped in presummit talks aimed at opening the Japanese market to imports, breaking the deadlock in the world trade talks, and getting other G-7 countries to come up with money for Russia, U.S. officials are now talking about the primacy of economic-growth issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0.439110\n",

The Federal Reserve Board acts to discourage the stock market. It raises the discount rate from IV2 to 1% percent. It boosts margin r equ irements from 60 percent to 70 percent.

      "Michael Mierzewski, a Washington lawyer, noticed last spring that the room rate at the Big Sur resort he and his wife, Kathy, were visiting was down from previous years. He couldn't help noticing the freebies. The Ventana Inn & Spa (currently $410 to $1,077 per night for a double) was offering a daily free spa session. His choice, a massage.\"I suspect once the economy picks up and people are less afraid to travel, that we'll go back to more normal pricing of hotel rooms, and the free amenities will become less available than they are now,\" Mierzewski, 51, said recently.But some hotels may be hoping for guests who don't notice everything, such as amenities that have disappeared. At some Ritz- Carlton hotels, the \"bath butler\"  who draws a guest's bath and sprinkles aromatic oils or a few flower petals into it  is gone from the menu of services. For the luxury chain, it's not a \"must- have.\" \"In order to save people's jobs in the last few months, we had to temporarily discontinue things in a few hotels,\" company spokeswoman Vivian A. Deuschl said. \"And it is a temporary thing.\"It can be no surprise to anyone who pays attention to the news that travel and tourism have yet to recover from a two-year triple whammy of recession, terrorism and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Airlines are going belly-up, and hotels and resorts the world over are complaining about low occupancy rates. Most hotels or resorts with more than 100 rooms are aiming for the meeting and convention business, industry officials say, but the business traveler seems to have fallen off a cliff back in 1998 and has yet to reappear on the scene.The uncertainty of the world tourism market has sent luxury hoteliers off in various directions looking for the right formula that will let them attract customers but also stay healthy financially. Some are offering package deals they once never contemplated. Others are concentrating on the important amenities while cutting back the nonessential. When resorts feel squeezed, says John S. Fareed, director of the consulting firm Resort Marketing Partners, fresh-cut flowers, free newspapers, shoeshine mitts and brand-name shampoos disappear. Even towels in the room may be less plentiful.    0.432645\n",
      "Easy Money Tugs Two Ways at Trade GapThe trade deficit is a case study in the unintended consequences of easy money.The Commerce Department releases April trade data Wednesday morning. Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports  though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.429686\n",

      "It was a bumpy year for So Others Might Eat, the District-based charity known as SOME, which provides food, clothing, medical care and other services to those in need.Just months before the charity was to open a glossy building in Northwest Washington, the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, and SOME's donations plummeted 30 percent as Americans turned their attention - - and wallets  to that cause. Then came the anthrax postal scare, and the charity group's mail dried up for several weeks.For a nonprofit organization that gets more than half its funding in small donations through the mail, it was a staggering one-two punch, said development coordinator Shonna Milliken Humphrey.But last week, the 30-year-old organization finally got some good news. Employees participating in the workplace fundraising campaign of the United Way of the National Capital Area had designated $1.4 million for SOME  a whopping 40 percent more than in the previous year. The news was a big relief to the organization.The picture has similarly brightened for some other charities that were predicting hard times in the fall. After donating almost $2 billion to Sept. 11 funds nationally, Americans seem to have returned to supporting their usual causes. Although not all charities have rebounded to their pre-Sept. 11 levels, many now report that their worst fears never came to pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.425548\n",
      "Strong income gains and unseasonably warm weather prompted consumers to spend more money than usual in January. Along with data showing manufacturing activity expanded in February, that suggests the economy is on track for robust first-quarter growth.Personal income of Americans increased 0.7% in January, the biggest jump since September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.Consumer spending is \"strengthening sharply in the first quarter\" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is \"recovering after the post-hurricane lull\" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements. Excluding these special factors, personal income increased 0.4% in January, BEA says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.422961\n",
      "Dow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK  Anything big caps can do, small caps can do better, some analysts say.While many investors are talking about large-stock indexes gaining in 2003 after three years of declines, small stocks are outperforming big stocks so far this year and could continue their run, say strategists who follow small-cap stocks.The analysts cite the strong showing the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has made, after beginning the year on a down note, with a burst so powerful that the small-cap barometer has surpassed the large-cap Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index so far this year.\"It's been quiet a substantial rally over the last couple of months,\" said Steven DeSanctis, chief small-cap strategist at Prudential Equity Group. \"And the showing gives me confidence small stocks will end up doing better for the year.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.422424\n",
      "NEW YORK  A sharp decline in the dollar prompted another round of inflationary fears in the credit markets yesterday as bond prices tumbled.\"If you had to sum it up in one word, the word is currency,\" said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. In the Treasury bond market, \"we had a sell-off on our hands\" as the slump in the dollar continued.Recent economic reports indicating a widening U.S. trade deficit \"were sufficiently negative that the dollar likely will decline\" further in coming weeks to the lows reached last spring, said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. \"The weaker dollar and the perception that it will generate higher inflation is a problem for the bond market.\"Prices of 30-year Treasury issues fell nearly 1 1/2 points, or almost $15 for each $1,000 face amount as yields on some long-term bonds approached 9%. Corporate and municipal securities also plummeted.The dollar's slide also triggered a sell-off in the stock market where the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined nearly 46 points. Despite worries that a weakening dollar will exacerbate inflation pressure, \"inflation likely will remain relatively subdued,\" said Mr. Lieberman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.413044\n",
      "Let'stalk about the economics of the war. We're told that it's frightfully expensive (perhaps $1 billion a day) and that perhaps we ought to pay for it with a surtax. Please, keep cool. Yes, the war may ultimately cost tens of billions of dollars, but as wars go, it will be relatively cheap. And this is not the right moment for new taxes.The important thing about the war's cost is that it's not very important. The stakes in this war are lives and the long-term question of whether the Middle East becomes more - or less - stable. By comparison, the economic burdens are modest. The United States can easily afford a longer war if that would minimize casualties. And the United States is rich enough to maintain a military presence in the Persian Gulf if that would enhance postwar stability.What's lost in all the panicky talk about price tags is the enormousness of the U.S. economy. As an economic contest, this war is already an unfair mismatch. Even when Iraq is pumping oil, its gross national product (perhaps $60 billion or maybe less) roughly equals the output of Kentucky. This is about one-hundredth the size of the U.S. economy (1990 GNP: $5.5 trillion). The idea that America's economic base can't support this war is absurd.The worries partly reflect our obsession with budget deficits. But the deficit preoccupation obscures larger issues. The major economic effects of the crisis so far have involved psychology, not deficits. Anxiety and high oil prices have depressed consumer spending and business investment, worsening the recession.The truth is that the United States is now fighting this war out of its hip pocket. By itself, the war spending isn't large enough either to cripple the economy or - the other bit of conventional wisdom - immediately end the recession. There's a paradox here. Over the years, weapons prices have risen, and defense costs have fallen. A new F-15E fighter costs a hefty $50 million. Nevertheless, military spending (about $300 billion annually before the war) runs at roughly 5.5 percent of GNP. By contrast, it approached 40 percent of GNP at its peak in World War II, 14 percent in the Korean War and 9 percent in the Vietnam War.                                           0.412005\n"

      "A sharp increase in the number of unemployed persons in Washington's suburbs pushed the metropolitan-area unemployment rate to 4.0 percent in December, its highest level in six years, according to figures released yesterday.Unemployment in the District fell significantly, from 6.9 percent in November to 6.5 percent. But officials said the drop mostly reflected Christmas-season hiring, not a turnaround in the troubled economy.Christmastime hiring in the entire area was only about half what it has been over the last five years. From September to December 1990, 10,800 jobs were added in the retail trade, according to Richard Groner of the D.C. Department of Employment Services, which compiles the area statistics. Over the previous five years, the average increase in jobs during the same period was 21,000.In Maryland, which also released its unemployment rate yesterday, joblessness went up from 5.3 percent in November to 6.0 percent in December. Officials of the state Department of Economic and Employment Development said jobs were lost in the construction, auto-manufacturing, restaurant and hotel sectors, among others.The Virginia unemployment rate, released earlier this week, was 4.9 percent in December, up from 4.5 percent the previous month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.479739\n",
      "WASHINGTON  First-time claims for state unemployment insurance slipped by 2,000 to 301,000 last week, indicating the labor market remains extremely tight, the Labor Department said.The four-week moving average for claims  considered a better gauge of labor-market conditions  fell by 4,000 to 303,000 for the week, the lowest level since Aug. 7, 1997.In a separate report earlier in the week, the Labor Department said the number of American workers laid off from 1995 to 1997 dropped sharply from the prior three-year period. A total of 3.6 million workers were \"displaced,\" according to the government's biannual survey, down nearly 15% from 1993-95. The study includes data from 1995 in both time periods.The study, reported in yesterday's New York Times, also found that getting laid off caused less trouble for workers as the economy improved. About three-fourths of people who lost jobs from 1995-97 found new jobs fairly quickly, a slight improvement over 1993-95.More than half of those who found new jobs earned as much or more than they had in their earlier jobs, a seven-percentage-point improvement over 1993-95. And while one in four laid-off workers suffered an income drop of 20% or more when they were re-employed, that was down from the one-third who saw such a decline in 1993-95.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.457742\n",
      "WASHINGTON  Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in two years as the holiday season failed to lift the spirit of Americans rattled by stock-market volatility and mounting fears of a significant economic slowdown.The Conference Board said consumer confidence slid to 128.3 in December from a revised 132.6 a month earlier. The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop.The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth.Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one.That prospect was very much on the minds of Conference Board officials, who described the fall in confidence as \"somewhat disconcerting.\"    0.412327\n",

      "NEW. YORK, June 14 UP).ÛÓ The stock market held well to its high level prices this week, but there was a broad element of indecision present all the time.I As a matter of statistical record the stock market ended exactly where it was a week ago, at S105.30 as measured by the associated press average of 60 stocks.At that point the market was only 50 cents under the 1952 high which was the best level in 22 years. The peak was reached last Monday.Collapse of talks between steel industry management and labor under Government auspices to end the two-week old strike left the stock market with a feeling of where are we now? As a fruitless attempt I was made to work out a formula for production of steel needed by defense industries.There were some 650,000 steel workers idle, and another 100,-000 in allied industries were out of work. That second list of idle was scheduled to grow rapidly unless the steel strike ended quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.407259\n",

Bush.Ehrlich said Tuesday that he plans to run a forward-looking campaign, disputing characterizations of the race as a grudge match.\"The last thing that people want to see is a schoolyard, middle-school, who-struck-John, bully stuff right now,\" he said. \"They want to hear your ideas about how you're going to fix it.

      "Paris  NOT LONG ago, European officials, corporate executives, economists, fund managers and investment bankers had a dream: European companies would be weaned off their penchant for debt financing and rely more on equity for growth. Insurance companies would buy more shares and fewer bonds. Governments would get out of the business of owning whole industries.In short, Continental Europe would begin to look a lot like the U.S. and United Kingdom. The process was rather clumsily called \"equitization.\"Then came the bear market. IPOs became an endangered species. Many investors abandoned Europe's stock markets. The de-stocking  de- equitization, in market-speak  of Europe set in.Strategists at Citigroup Smith Barney in London figure that after stripping out market moves, the value of Europe's stock markets (excluding the U.K.) has shrunk by about 0.5% in the past year. In other words, the delisting of stock exceeded the listing of stock, after 20 years when the net new supply of stock increased at an average rate of 8.1% a year.\"You've never seen anything like this in Europe,\" says Robert Buckland, the firm's head of pan-European equity strategy. \"The creation of equity is hitting a brick wall, big time.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.400443\n",
      "Macy's announced yesterday that it will eliminate 7,000 jobs by May 1 as it undertakes a massive reorganization in the face of slumping sales and depressed consumer spending.The cuts represent about 4 percent of the company's 180,000-person workforce. Stores will lose an average of five to six employees, while about 40 percent of management positions will be cut, Macy's said. The Washington region, however, is expected to get a boost of 70 jobs under the restructuring.In addition, Macy's said it will begin repurchasing about $950 million in debt that will mature later this year, which should help reduce interest expense. It also said that it was lowering the quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 13.25 cents.The company estimated that its cost-cutting will save $250 million this year and $400 million annually in the future. It is also slashing capital expenditures to $450 million from an original estimate of $1 billion, lowering contributions to employees' 401(k) plans and eliminating merit raises for executives this spring.\"We just believe that this is a time when nothing should be considered a sacred cow,\" Macy's chief executive Terry J.

      "The U.S. economy grew at just a 2.4 percent annual rate in the July-September period, the slowest pace in four years, according to revised figures released yesterday by the Commerce Department.An unusual decline in federal government purchases of goods and services and smaller gains in business spending on new equipment and inventories were the primary reasons for the substantial drop from the second quarter's 5.6 percent growth rate.Commerce last month initially estimated third-quarter growth at a 2.7 percent rate, but more complete data recently available caused the downward revision.As they had when the original figures were released, however, a number of analysts said the nation's economic situation remains solid with growth likely to pick up again to between a 3 percent and 4 percent rate in the final three months of the year and continue in that range for some time.\"The headline was a lot weaker than underlying demand,\" said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. \"Private domestic demand grew at a 4.4 percent rate in the third quarter, far from indicating any serious problems in the broad economy.

      "Deflation knocked louder at the door of the U.S. economy as the Bridge Commodity Research Bureau index ended the day at a 12-year low.The index, composed of 17 major commodity prices, slipped early in the day below an August 1992 intraday low of 198.17  seen as a key benchmark  and dipped to 197.72 before settling down 1.65 at 198.12. That marked its lowest close since 1986. The move was the latest slip in the index's year-long 39.57-point fall from 237.69, signaling commodity markets' two-year bear market may be picking up steam rather than abating.The Goldman Sachs index of spot commodity prices also slipped 1.41 to 139.6070, its lowest level since 1977.Most industry observers don't believe commodity prices will recover any time soon. \"It's falling like a stone,\" said Ray Murphy, president of RTM Management Inc., who helped Bridge/CRB create a CRB total-returns index tailored to investors like pension funds. \"There's plenty of supply of everything and no demand. Where it bottoms out could be anyone's guess.\"And the free fall could have implications for other areas of the economy as well. Robert Hafer, managing director at Bridge/CRB, said the CRB traditionally is an advance indicator of what conditions will be like in six to 12 months. He says if deflation spreads, it will show up next in producer prices and then consumer prices. That, he said, could necessitate a cut in interest rates. For now, however, the inflation-shy Federal Reserve appears unwilling to consider such a move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.380309\n",
      "The Federal Reserve Board yesterday fired its expected salvo I in its fight against inflation, approving discount rate rises in four districts. Starting today, commercial banks must pay 3 per cent for funds borrowed from Reserve banks in New York,Commercial banks expected the move and earlier this week hiked their prime rate, the money charge to top borrowers. Thus the Reserves action was seen as primarily a symbol.A Board spokesman said it reflects a belief that, the business outlook appears good. We dont want it upset by credit excesses.*But a practical effect will be to make it more expensive for banks to add to their reserves by borrowing and enlarge their lending power. This, Reserve officials hope, will induce banks to turn down marginal borrowers.Reserve aides are hoping to stretch out the swelling plant and equipment boom through next year. They are alarmed over a growing tendency to pay for this capital expansion through short-term bank loans instead of borrowing at the climbing long-term rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.347376\n",
      "I would like to thank Messrs. Culver, Scott and Hawn (Letters to the Editor, Nov. 10) for the opportunity to correct several of their common misunderstandings about fuel grade ethanol.Dave Culver, in his concern over the projected production cost of ethanol, makes no mention of the true costs of imported oil. When externalities such as environmental and health costs, the loss of domestic jobs and basic industries, the trade deficit, commitments of military resources to ensure the free flow of oil from the Middle East and threats to our energy and national security are included, the true cost of imports even now exceeds $100/bbl, according to the General Accounting Office.Mr. Culver is off by a factor of almost 10 in his claim that \"Vehicles that consume a 10% mixture of `gasohol' typically see a 20% loss in fuel mileage.\" Between 2% and 4% is correct. He is a bit closer in his description of E-85 vehicles. At this time, they experience about a 20% reduction in range compared to gasoline. That will improve with higher compression ratio engines allowed by ethanol's 113 octane. He is just flat wrong about fires and fuel system incompatibility with ethanol.John W. Scott is correct in warning that the production of ethanol and other biofuels from feed grains and oilseeds, from agriculture and forestry residues, fast growing trees and grasses and well as from urban biomass heading for the dump, must ensure environmental integrity from the dirt to the tailpipe. The sloshing down the river of 15 gallons of top soil for every gallon of ethanol simply does not occur with modern, environmentally sound farming practices including crop rotation, conservation tillage, planting and harvesting, filter strips and the scientific use of agricultural chemicals. As the nation commercializes the conversion of ethanol and other biofuels from cellulosic biomass, the planting of grasses and trees on erodible land will bring increasing levels of top soil to farm lands, a process already well under way.Richard G. Hawn needs to visit Brazil to verify his claims of poor-running cars and double-the-size gas tanks. Essentially all cars in Brazil run on ethanol, either in blends of 22% ethanol/78% gasoline or 99% ethanol (a little touch of denaturant to keep the imbibers away). They run well and the public is pleased. The fuel tanks are about 20% larger than they would be if straight gasoline were used. He is right about the Btu content of ethanol being lower than gasoline  76,000 Btu compared with about 119,000 for gasoline. But he neglected to mention that the increased thermal efficiency of ethanol when combusted and its much higher octane permits engine designs that will almost remove the Btu advantage of gasoline. He also failed to mention that air quality in San Paulo Brazil, with a population of 14 million, is better than in Los Angeles, New York City or Houston Texas. There are, of course, \"externalities\" in this observation  and I will show mine when the oil companies show theirs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.341871\n",

      "Don't be misled by the title of this book. Though Murray Sperber discusses big-time college athletics at length and with impressive asperity, his real subject is the decline of undergraduate education at what he calls \"Big-time U,\" the \"large public university with high- profile football and/or men's basketball teams playing at the highest NCAA levels.\" At many of these institutions, he argues, \"beer-and- circusthe party scene connected to big-time college sports events replaces meaningful undergraduate education.\" The case he marshals against these places\"schools\" scarcely seems the right wordis overwhelming, a devastating condemnation of \"higher education\" in America.Sperber teaches English at the Indiana University, where for years he has enjoyed the dubious privilege of observing Big-time U at intimate range. The basketball program there, under the egregious, and finally fired, Bobby Knight, may or may not embody all the worst excesses of Division 1A athleticsSperber calls Florida State University the \"national champs\" of beer and circus, and with ample reasonbut it certainly is a leading contender. Because of his outspoken views on big-time athletics generally and Knight specifically, Sperber is a controversial figure on his own campus, but that has not stopped him from speaking out or from writing books, of which Beer and Circus is the most important.Much of what he says in the book has been said before, by him (in a previous book, College Sports, Inc.) and by others. What is new here is the direct connection he makes between two phenomena that would seem at first glance to be unrelated. Just about everyone knows that under the enthusiastic management of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, big-time football and basketball programs have become the tail that wags the academic dog, and just about everybody knows that almost every undergraduate at these big schools is, as a freshman at Ohio State told Sperber, \"just another number,\" rolled through the assembly line with little if any attention from tenured faculty and not much more from the graduate students and teaching assistants who shoulder so much of what passes for the academic load.Sperber argues that these phenomena feed off each other. The big public universities (and some of the private ones as well) are engaged in an unseemly competition for prestige as reflected in the frivolous but influential rankings of U.S. News and World Report and other publications. These are based principally on graduate programs and research, helping persuade university administrators \"that research prestige was the way to attract attention to their institution and to improve its standing in the academic world.\" A few years ago, I listened with still-undiminished horror as the newly crowned chief administrator of my alma mater told alumni (and anyone else who would listen) that his chief goal for the institution was to elevate it to Number One among public universities at U.S. News that ambition seems to be universal.But ambitions such as that are expensive, and universities need funds to underwrite them. Enter the undergraduate, whose tuition and fees these universities covet and for whom they compete energetically. \"In the 1980s,\" Sperber writes, \"some higher education officials began to discuss 'the student as consumer'. . . . Colleges and universities needed to fill their classrooms and dorms . . . and, as a result, except for the most prestigious schools in the country, the demographic crunch of the 1980s and early 1990s transformed admissions from a selection process to a sales campaign, often involving clever scams.\"    0.338751\n",
      "The new figures on unemployment strongly suggest that the time has come for more drastic-measures to reshape and reinvigorate the national productive effort. Conferences among top Administration officials at the White House indicate that some such measures are being formulated. But if there is to be a genuine rebirth of confidence, without which the slump cannot be arrested, whatever program is being formulated must have some real substance. Mere restatements of the presidential optimism, it is now plain, will not suffice.At the same time, it needs to be kept constantly in mind that powerful forces of expansion are still present which, unrestrained, could again lead, quickly to unacceptable inflation. The capacity to build homes, for example, and the need for more housing are as strong as ever and will grow stronger in the decade ahead. The same is true in many other fields. What is required is just enough new incentive to get the ball rolling what is to be avoided is a slam-bang, crash program that would in a short time require .severe hew restraints to prevent a price runaway.If a tax cut should become necessary to trigger a resumption of growth, most assuredly it should contain an automatic repeal provision. Federal spending needs to be increased by several billions annually if urgent defense and domestic needs are to be met. An increase in the 1959 budget goals would also have a considerable tonic effect on the economy. If, later on, it appeared that higher spending was having an inflationary effect, the budget could be restored to balance by a tax increase. For this year and perhaps for the next, however, a deficit would certainly be no cause for alarm.As for monetary controls, the Federal Reserve Board ought to encourage further cuts in the rediscount rate at once. Very soon it should case bank reserve requirements if the situation does not improve. These actions arc easily reversible. The very fact that the financial community knows thisÛÓand knows that reversal would come swiftly if requiredÛÓmeans that fairly vigorous actions to case credit restraint are required to induce an actual credit expansion. The two cuts in' the Fed rediscount rate made since the current recession began last fall have not been strong enough medicine.An immediate and determined Administration drive for long-term renewal of the Trade Agreements Act and for a real expansion of foreign economic development aid also would have a useful effect in restoring confidence. The slump in exports is serious and cannot be altogclhcr offsel by any foreseeable expansion of Government or private spending in this country. If the Nation does not act to insure a steadily growing market for its goods overseas, it will inevitably and critically stunt its economic growth. Significantly, those countries which in recent years have outstripped the rate of American economic growth have been nations which, like Germany, the Netherlands and Japan, have been pushing foreign trade to the hilt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.338569\n",
      "Copper futures prices were firm again on indications of an improved economy and prospective demand for the metal.May delivery copper rose 2.75 cents a pound to $1.06, for a two-day gain of 5.5 cents. The market ignored an increase of 684 tons in warehouse stocks of New York's Commodity Exchange to 11,529 tons.\"There's a generally more positive attitude toward the economy,\" said Bette Raptapoulos, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. \"You have the more than 20% increase in new home sales in February and the housing market is a key user of copper.\"William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures, New York, observed that while trading lacked distinction, the premium commanded by the May futures contract over more distant months was a key indicator of the strength in the market.\"One spread that traders are closely watching is the May-December,\" he said. The premium of May over December rose 0.75 cent a pound to 15.8 cents, he said, which indicates \"concern during forthcoming months about supplies of copper to meet demand.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.332526\n",
      "The recent surge in interest rates is not the result of any tightening of Federal Reserve monetary policy, according to senior Fed officials.\"We didn't stir this up deliberately,\" one senior official said yesterday, indicating there has been no Fed action to make cash less readily available to the nation's banking system.Instead, the official said, financial markets are \"having a minicrisis of confidence\" brought on by the persistent weakness of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, which has revived fears of higher inflation in the future. The dollar's weakness in turn is related to the continuing large federal budget deficit and the U.S. trade deficit, he said.Meanwhile, Fed Governor H. Robert Heller said yesterday weak economic growth in other major industrial nations makes it inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.In an interview with Dow Jones, Heller said there is \"little or no growth\" occurring in Japan and West Germany. \"For us to raise interest rates in that situation would not be very appropriate,\" he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.328685\n",
      "Q: Are preferred shares a good investment in this market and are they closer to bonds or stocks?A: Preferred shares are complex investments that have similarities to both equities and debt. Preferred shares trade like stocks and are a claim on the assets and earnings of a company, just like common shares. But they hold a higher claim on the assets than common stock. That makes preferreds a somewhat safer investment.While preferred shares usually don't have voting rights, they pay a regular dividend that can be substantial, making them similar in some ways to bonds. Dividends paid by preferred shares usually must be paid out before common shareholders receive their dividends.\"Preferred shares are slightly more like bonds than stocks as their historical price volatility more closely matches that of bonds,\" says Andrew Zimmerman, chief investment strategist at DT Investment Partners LLC. Just like bonds, they can be called by the issuer in times of falling interest rates, he notes.\"Since preferred shares are sensitive to interest-rate movements, their prices fall when interest rates rise and vice versa,\" he says. \"However, since they offer such relatively high yields, the income component of preferred shares can help to offset the price decline in periods of small interest-rate spikes.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.328490\n",
      "No matter how much Congress and President Clinton can agree to trim the federal budget deficit, as long as there is a deficit of any size, the national debt will continue to mount. With the administration projecting that the budget deficit will fall little between now and 2000, the resulting steady rise in the debt means that interest payments will continue to climb and pass the $300 billion mark at the end of the decade.Interest on the debt is becoming increasingly costly. Last year's federal budget deficit would have been a scant $200 million were it not for the $203 billion the government had to pay the public in interest.By 1997, the interest payments  which are partially offset by interest received from the public and by interest received by government trust funds, such as those for Social Security and civil service retirees  will be greater than defense spending. At that point, only Social Security payments will claim a greater chunk of the budget than net interest payments.The chart at the right shows the strong link between the cost of financing the debt accumulated from past deficits and the annual amount of red ink in succeeding years.Obviously, many other factors have been at work, with the deficit exceeding net interest payments in all but two of the fiscal years from 1975 to 1994. However, the message of the chart is clear: The budget gap the new congressional Republican majority has vowed to close is perhaps not so much a matter of overspending today as of the decisions of past Congresses and presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, to borrow rather than balance budgets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.328103\n"

      "WASHINGTON  The Federal Reserve is likely, in light of November's strong employment figures, to decide to raise short-term interest rates at its policy meeting Dec. 14.Interviews with Fed governors and district presidents who make up the central bank's policy committee suggest that many of them believe higher interest rates are needed to cool down the economy and prevent an acceleration of inflation.The 463,000-job increase in payroll employment \"was far bigger than anyone thought it was going to be,\" said Robert Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The latest numbers add to \"anecdotal information from our district that the economy continues to be robust,\" agrees Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins. \"There is some sign here that policy should continue to err on the side of containing inflation.\"But the Fed is unlikely to take decisive action before the Dec. 14 meeting unless it is confronted with a steep decline in the dollar. That's because officials are reluctant to appear overly responsive to monthly employment figures. \"Taking one month's figures and reacting in a knee-jerk manner is inappropriate for policymakers,\" says Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Fed, expressing a view that was echoed by other Fed officials.The presidents of the 12 Fed district banks have been leading the charge this year for a tighter monetary policy. The employment figures out Friday clearly reinforced their hawkish views. \"I can't claim I was terribly surprised by the tenor of the report,\" said Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Fed. \"The economy out here for quite some time now has been doing well.\"    0.441150\n",

      "Here's how some major bills fared recently in Congress and how local congressional members voted, as provided by Thomas's Roll Call Report Syndicate. NV means Not Voting.The House approved a motion that had the effect of giving members of Congress a 2.7 percent pay increase, raising their salary to about $145,100 in January 2001.Had opponents of the pay raise won this vote, they would have offered a motion to kill the automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). They mounted this procedural attack after House leaders denied them debate and a direct, up- or-down vote on the merits of raising congressional pay. The vote occurred during debate on a Treasury Department funding bill for fiscal 2001 (HR 4871).The House approved tax breaks to help individuals invest more of their earnings in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans and other retirement vehicles. The bill (HR 1102) is projected to cost the Treasury $52.2 billion over 10 years.It would raise the IRA contribution limit for individuals from $2,000 today to $3,000 in 2001, $4,000 in 2002 and $5,000 in 2003, and begin adjusting IRA contribution limits for inflation. For individuals older than 50, the new $5,000 limit would take effect as soon as the bill became law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.425779\n",

Two years ago, Mr. Barnard filed suit against the bar in federal court, claiming his mandatory dues were being spent on \"frivolous things that are nonessential to the practice of law.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.416011\n",
      "If the stock market recovers from yesterday's pounding, there could be three popular formulas for getting rich: Buying earnings plays, inflation plays or restructuring plays. Paper stocks, a triple play, might get some attention.Shares of companies such as International Paper, Scott Paper, Federal Paper Board and Bowater seem to have everything going for them. While many other companies are reporting disappointing profits, the paper industry is showing better results than expected.Moreover, prices for linerboard and other products have been rising. And the stocks, which tumbled after outrunning the S&P 500 in the first quarter, are comparative bargains. Some people think they might tempt raiders, as did Hammermill in 1986 before International Paper acquired it.But recently, paper stocks have disappointed their fans. Some, like International Paper, are more than 15% below 1987 highs, even though analysts expect more big industry earnings gains well into 1988.Anyone buying paper shares in recent months has underperformed the market, says Tom Farrell, analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital in New York. Speculators haven't so far made much money, despite sporadic rumors that raiders might be after Mead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.412173\n",
      "JIM PAULSEN, the chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, ticks off the ingredients needed for a mean batch of inflation.\"I would flood the system with money far in excess of economic growth, I would take interest rates to the lowest levels possible, I would have the government spend like a banshee, I would drop the value of the dollar, and finally I would take any capacity growth or additional supply growth and stop it,\" he says. As a garnish, he'dadd rising commodity prices and a growing trade deficit mixed with some rising trade tensions.Sound familiar? As investors close the books on 2003 and look out into next year, some are worrying that inflation, which had been banished in the past few years, is poised for a comeback. Were that to happen, it would terrify bond investors and shake up the stock market, while giving a boon to some manufacturers, which finally would be able to raise prices.\"Last fall we were all worried about deflation,\" says Mr. Paulsen. \"What could happen by summer is everyone could be panicked about inflation.\"That panic may be based more on emotion and expectations than on anything else. There are lots of good reasons why inflation should remain tame, mainly the lack of a strong jobs market. But as investors spend much of their time trying to divine the future, expectations are what will drive stocks and bonds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.411120\n",

      "WASHINGTON  The head of the presidential task force investigating the October stock market crash said that the market plunged essentially because it was too high.In his first wide-ranging interview since being named to lead the task force, investment banker and former senator Nicholas F. Brady, discussing the causes of the crash, said that \"the stock market was incredibly high, by all the standards that we measure it by. When values get exaggerated, any number of things can make it rearrange itself.\" Thus, he said, \"I think everything that's been mentioned (as a cause) played a role.\"Mr. Brady, the co-head of Dillon, Read & Co., emphasized that the five members of the commission haven't yet come to any conclusions. \"We haven't started to argue among ourselves about what we think,\" he said.But Mr. Brady did indicate what his views are on several subjects, including portfolio insurance, leverage in the markets, and possible manipulation of the market during the turbulence of Oct. 19 and 20. He also discussed the methodology of the task force's study.Mr. Brady suggested indirectly that he wouldn't support limiting the use of the computerized hedging strategy known as portfolio insurance. When asked about portfolio insurance, he said: \"We have a tendency in this country to fix things that are about to right themselves. If that (portfolio insurance) was a problem  and I don't know that it was  the market may take care of it.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.399476\n",
      "The number of self-reported million-dollar earners in Maryland has dropped by roughly a third compared with this time last year, renewing debate yesterday about whether the state's year-old \"millionaires' tax\" is driving rich people beyond its borders.The data from April's tax filings, released by the comptroller's office, came with a couple of big caveats. At least part of the drop-off in Marylanders whose returns showed more than $1 million in taxable income was certainly due to the recession and the decline it has brought in earnings from capital gains and real estate. And the figures do not include taxpayers who filed for extensions.Still, the \"substantial decline\" in million-dollar earners filing on time was enough for the comptroller's office to announce that it will \"be thoroughly analyzing these returns and their implications.\" And it was enough for opponents of the state's new surcharge to say, in essence, \"I told you so.\" \"I don't think anyone can dispute that some people have left Maryland,\" said Senate Minority Leader Allan H. Kittleman (R-Howard). \"That's what we were trying to explain when we were voting on this.\"Among the skeptics, however, was Warren Descheneaux, the chief fiscal adviser to the legislature, which last year raised the state's top marginal tax rate, applied to income above $1 million, from 5.5 percent to 6.25 percent.The new rate, which is set to expire after three years, was expected to affect roughly 6,000 taxpayers, about 40 percent of whom reside in Montgomery County, based on the previous year's tax data.                                                                                  0.398395\n"
