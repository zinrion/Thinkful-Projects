      "I recently had the privilege of working closely with two men of uncommon courage  Andrew F. Brimmer, former chair of the D.C. financial control board, and Julius W. Becton Jr., former chief executive officer and superintendent of the D.C. public schools.Before taking up their work in the District, these men had climbed the heights of their chosen professions. Brimmer was one of the leading economists in the United States and a member of the Federal Reserve Board. Becton had retired, after 40 years of service, as a U.S. Army lieutenant general. Both Brimmer and Becton are members of what Thomas Jefferson called that \"natural aristocracy,\" based not upon birth but upon \"virtue and talents.\"Brimmer and Becton volunteered for arduous and time-consuming positions in our community in a time of troubles. They did this not for recognition, of which each already had received a full measure, but because they hoped to make a difference. And they did make a difference.Brimmer helped put the District on the road to recovery and reform. Changing the city's course was like turning a battleship in a storm, but his firm hand on the helm managed to bring the ship around. Likewise, Becton laid the groundwork for a better school system, which he left to the control of his chosen successor, Arlene Ackerman.The Bible says that a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country. Although neither Becton nor Brimmer would claim the mantle of prophet, each in his own way blazed a trail for others to follow toward a better future for the District. As the Bible also says, men such as these are \"the glory of their times.\" They need no defense from me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.574123\n",
      "STOCKS LOST momentum and ended the day lower on light trading volume, as a dearth of economic news left investors to fret over high oil prices, persistently high Treasury yields and the robust price of gold and other commodities.Stocks kicked off the day higher to extend Monday's gains, with an initial boost from strong earnings of aluminum-maker Alcoa and mobile- phone firm Nokia. But share prices soon turned south as investors worried about inflation, particularly in commodities. Signs of inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, which can cool enthusiasm for stocks as investors seek higher yields from bonds.Renewed concern about a possible slowdown in consumer spending and corporate earnings growth as a result of higher rates pushed down the Dow Jones Industrial Average 51.70 points, or 0.46%, to 11089.63 points, or up 3.5% this year.Crude-oil futures settled up 24 cents at $68.98 a barrel, after climbing to a seven-month high of $69.45 Monday night. Oil is up 13% this year. Investors continued to worry about political tensions related to Iran's nuclear program as well as a production outage and unrest in oil-producing Nigeria.\"Low [trading] volume, commodity inflation and geopolitical issues  a lot of little things today,\" said Larry Peruzzi, a stock trader at Boston Company Asset Management in Boston. \"There wasn't a knockout blow, but the damage was done through a lot of jabs to the midsection.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.569126\n",
      "NEW DELHIA fund-management giant in its U.S. home market, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is finding India tough to crack.Two years ago, T. Rowe joined a long line of Western financial firms hoping to tap into India's growing wealth and bought a large stake in the country's oldest mutual-fund company.But the investment in Mumbai-based UTI Asset Management Co. has been dogged by discord with the Indian partners, slackening in India's mutual-fund industry and slippage of UTI's market share. T. Rowe's woes also underscore the difficulties facing some foreign money managers in the country.Though Indian laws allow foreign companies to fully own mutual-fund companies, T. Rowe, like some other foreign rivals, entered India through a joint venture, hoping to eventually increase its ownership. The Baltimore-based company in 2010 teamed up with four government-owned financial groups, which sold T. Rowe an equal portion of their UTI equity for a total of $140 million. The deal made T. Rowe the single-largest holder in UTI, with 26%.But that didn't help when UTI's chairman and managing director, U.K. Sinha, left last February to head India's capital markets regulator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.564058\n",

      "Companies going global in a big way are learning to think small when it comes to their headquarters.Gone are the armies of workers in downtown skyscrapers  and vanishing quickly is the idea of a headquarters as the nerve center of a company. Under pressure to cut costs and eliminate redundancies, executives are abandoning lavish digs for simpler spaces, slashing many jobs and outsourcing others. At the same time, many companies are giving overseas operations leeway to make big policy decisions that used to be reserved for the home office.\"The brains of the organization aren't only where the head is,\" says Christopher Bartlett, a Harvard Business School professor. \"The smarts are located all over the world, and the challenge nowadays is finding the best ways to connect them.\"In this new climate, just what makes for a good home base? Landmark buildings in the company's founding city don't cut the mustard anymore, according to corporate-relocation experts. A global company must be close to its major markets, with easy access to an international airport. It doesn't hurt to have access to a multilingual local population  not to mention one rich with executive talent.Indeed, getting out of the hometown may be an advantage for many established companies. Citicorp Chairman John Reed, fearing his executives are too caught up in the comings and goings of New York's financial community, has threatened publicly to pull the company headquarters out of New York. Says a Citicorp spokesman: \"If you're caught up with seeing customers and visiting with people hung up in the business, it lowers your vision to what's happening right now.

In the past three weeks, Randolph has watched the price of butter climb on the Chicago Mercantile Exchangewhere wholesale prices are set from about $1.20 a pound to $1.80, a 50 percent increase.Randolph now expects the price he's been paying his supplier to rise accordingly before the year is over: \"We use a ton of butter a week, so this will put a little cramp in the business.\"Randolph said he doesn't plan to charge more for his products to recoup the cost \"because many customers won't be able to pay the price.\"But he said if prices \"get real bad,\" he may have to cut back production of some of the butter-laden holiday goods to keep his costs in line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.546207\n",

      "Black Friday didn't wait on the calendar this year as retailers invaded Thanksgiving with their much-hyped deep discounts and hopeful shoppers joined long lines a day early.Despite an outcry from traditionalists and some employees, national chains including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp., Sears Holdings Corp. and Toys \"R\" Us were opening their doors on Thursday. Others, like Best Buy Co., were waiting until midnight.The move was aimed at keeping up with online retailers, which last year took aim at the quintessentially bricks-and-mortar holiday by offering Thanksgiving Day deals.Retailers are racing to claim a bigger share of consumers' wallets. The long weekend can account for 15% or more of a chain store's holiday sales.While consumer confidence has improved, shoppers remain cautious, and the industry expects to be fighting over a slower-growing pie this year. Retail sales over the holidays are expected to expand just 4.1% to $586 billion, the lowest growth rate since the U.S. was coming out of a recession in 2009, according to the National Retail Federation.

      "In an apparent attempt to save the semiconductor trade accord signed with the U.S. last summer, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has directed the country's microchip producers to cut production 10% over the next three months.Japanese officials are hoping that reduced chip production would drive up prices for Japanese-made chips in Japan, and also in other Asian countries, where the U.S. has repeatedly accused Japanese chip makers of \"dumping,\" or selling exported chips below cost. U.S. officials have said they would scrap the once-heralded accord April 1, if the Japanese don't start living up to their agreements to stop dumping and to buy more U.S.-made chips. If the U.S. does abrogate the pact, it would probably implement stiff dumping penalties that Japanese producers want to avoid.But perhaps more important, Japanese chip-company executives said that reducing output may also serve a different purpose: to revive sagging sales and orders of commodity chip products so Japanese manufacturers can avoid plant closures and layoffs. These sources suggest that MITI isn't acting as much to save the chip agreement  which they say the Japanese government could do by simply ordering that chips be sold at higher prices  as it is to distribute the pain of the chip recession across the whole of the Japanese industry.The MITI output directive came in the form of the agency's semiconductor-production forecast initiated last September to guide planning by Japan's chip companies. A ministry spokesman said that although the forecast report isn't law, \"it sends a strong signal of MITI's desire\" to chip makers. In the past, such signals have influenced Japanese petrochemical companies and steelmakers, among others, to sharply curtail production.\"We don't punish people if our expectations aren't met,\" said the MITI spokesman, \"but I am sure it will play a role as a production guideline.\"    0.540242\n",

      "It was a bumpy year for So Others Might Eat, the District-based charity known as SOME, which provides food, clothing, medical care and other services to those in need.Just months before the charity was to open a glossy building in Northwest Washington, the Sept. 11 attacks occurred, and SOME's donations plummeted 30 percent as Americans turned their attention - - and wallets  to that cause. Then came the anthrax postal scare, and the charity group's mail dried up for several weeks.For a nonprofit organization that gets more than half its funding in small donations through the mail, it was a staggering one-two punch, said development coordinator Shonna Milliken Humphrey.But last week, the 30-year-old organization finally got some good news. Employees participating in the workplace fundraising campaign of the United Way of the National Capital Area had designated $1.4 million for SOME  a whopping 40 percent more than in the previous year. The news was a big relief to the organization.The picture has similarly brightened for some other charities that were predicting hard times in the fall. After donating almost $2 billion to Sept. 11 funds nationally, Americans seem to have returned to supporting their usual causes. Although not all charities have rebounded to their pre-Sept. 11 levels, many now report that their worst fears never came to pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.557636\n",
      "WASHINGTON  Before initiating legislation to change the way the financial markets work, the Senate Banking Committee seems inclined to give the existing regulatory structure a chance to implement some of the reforms recommended by the Brady task force.Four days of hearings by the panel last week made it clear that, less than a month after being released, the task force's central conclusion  that the separate financial markets actually operate as one  has become part of Washington's conventional wisdom. And the recommendations the presidential commission on the crash drew from that conclusion have effectively become the congressional agenda for change.But not for legislative action  at least this year.Most members of the banking panel reacted favorably to several of the Brady report's recommendations  especially its calls for better clearing systems for coordinated intermarket regulation and for cross-market \"circuit breakers,\" such as trading halts. But before trying to implement those changes themselves, by giving either the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission new powers, the lawmakers indicated they want to see if the current regulatory system can do the job.\"Try to do what you can, working cooperatively with the other bodies involved, to make the necessary changes in the markets without congressional action,\" Sen.

      "WASHINGTON  While debtor nations and their bankers scramble to deflect default, some government officials argue that a long-term solution to the international debt crisis isn't possible without changes in the world's monetary system.At the London developed-countries economic summit earlier this month, leaders of the seven major industrial democracies reiterated support for a study  started a year ago at the request of French President Francois Mitterrand  of \"ways to improve the operation of the international monetary system.\" The study's vague goals suggest a bureaucratic exercise to buy time. In the U.S., however, a small but vocal group of conservative economists wants fundamental changes in the monetary system  the sooner the better.\"International monetary reform will be the issue of the mid-'80s, just as tax reform was the issue of the early '80s,\" predicts Rep. Jack Kemp. The New York Republican says the U.S. should convene a second Bretton Woods Conference and lead the world back to a gold standard.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Bretton Woods, N.H., meeting that created the post-World War II monetary order  the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the system of fixed currency-exchange rates tied to the dollar, which in turn was anchored to gold. The bank and the fund remain, but fixed exchange rates collapsed in the early 1970s, when the U.S. stopped redeeming foreignheld dollars for gold and the world moved to its current system of floating exchange rates.Rep. Kemp and other gold advocates contend that since then the world has suffered from an expansion of debt, soaring inflation and high interest rates. Some of the measures endorsed at the London summit  longer loan-repayment periods for some nations and more private investment in development nations  may provide short-term relief from current debt difficulties. But gold advocates insist that only a return to the gold standard will lead to international financial stability.    0.501025\n",

      "The annual report of the president's Council of Economic Advisers released yesterday begins not with cautious assessment but a sweeping celebratory declaration: \"The past year saw the nation's economy turn in its best performance in a generation.\"The report ticked off the now-familiar figures for strong economic growth  the rapid rise in jobs, the drop in unemployment to a 24-year low and a decline in core inflation to the lowest level since the mid-1960s. \"The economy is remarkably free of the symptoms that often presage an economic downturn  such as an increase in inflation, an accumulation of inventories or evidence of financial imbalance,\" the council members wrote in the report.Only in the administration's forecast for the next three years does the CEA turn cautiously conservative.Like many private-sector economists, those at the CEA believe that some special factors, such as the huge run-up in the stock market, helped push inflation-adjusted economic growth to 3.2 percent in 1996 and 3.9 percent last year. As the impact of those forces wanes, so, too, will the nation's growth rate, which is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year and stay there for 1999 and 2000.\"We have had an utterly exceptional rate of growth,\" which has reduced unemployment to a level at or below that regarded as full employment by many economists, CEA Chairman Janet L.

      "More Liquidity Only Douses Growth SparksToday's ultralow interest rates have helped boost profits, but not economic growth.This is plainly evident in recent figures. Since the recession ended in mid-2009, U.S. corporate profits have jumped by about 43% to a record $1.45 trillion as of the first quarter, after taxes, inventory and accounting adjustments, according to the Commerce Department.What hasn't recovered, however, is economic growth. Indeed, in real terms, gross domestic product hasn't even returned to its prerecession peak.On Friday, Commerce data is likely to show GDP losing further ground. Second-quarter growth, originally reported at a measly 1.3%, is expected to be revised down to 1% in part because exports proved weaker than first thought. That follows GDP growth of just 0.4% in the first quarter, on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.487118\n"

      "Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. said Tuesday that he will try to win his old job back in November, confirming plans for a much-anticipated rematch with Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who defeated him in a bitter contest four years ago.A formal announcement, planned for next Wednesday in Montgomery County, will set up a rematch between two of the state's dominant political personalities.Both are fierce competitors. Their 2006 race was highly negative and at times intensely personal, with Ehrlich (R) repeatedly calling O'Malley \"a whiner\" and running ads that highlighted the homicide rate and struggling schools in Baltimore, where O'Malley was mayor. O'Malley (D) accused Ehrlich of dirty tricks and portrayed him as cozy with energy lobbyists and an unpopular President George W. Bush.Ehrlich said Tuesday that he plans to run a forward-looking campaign, disputing characterizations of the race as a grudge match.\"The last thing that people want to see is a schoolyard, middle-school, who-struck-John, bully stuff right now,\" he said. \"They want to hear your ideas about how you're going to fix it. They want to hear about your ideas about what you want to do.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0.487183\n",
      "WASHINGTON  First-time claims for state unemployment insurance slipped by 2,000 to 301,000 last week, indicating the labor market remains extremely tight, the Labor Department said.The four-week moving average for claims  considered a better gauge of labor-market conditions  fell by 4,000 to 303,000 for the week, the lowest level since Aug. 7, 1997.In a separate report earlier in the week, the Labor Department said the number of American workers laid off from 1995 to 1997 dropped sharply from the prior three-year period. A total of 3.6 million workers were \"displaced,\" according to the government's biannual survey, down nearly 15% from 1993-95. The study includes data from 1995 in both time periods.The study, reported in yesterday's New York Times, also found that getting laid off caused less trouble for workers as the economy improved. About three-fourths of people who lost jobs from 1995-97 found new jobs fairly quickly, a slight improvement over 1993-95.More than half of those who found new jobs earned as much or more than they had in their earlier jobs, a seven-percentage-point improvement over 1993-95. And while one in four laid-off workers suffered an income drop of 20% or more when they were re-employed, that was down from the one-third who saw such a decline in 1993-95.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.444357\n",

      "A sharp increase in the number of unemployed persons in Washington's suburbs pushed the metropolitan-area unemployment rate to 4.0 percent in December, its highest level in six years, according to figures released yesterday.Unemployment in the District fell significantly, from 6.9 percent in November to 6.5 percent. But officials said the drop mostly reflected Christmas-season hiring, not a turnaround in the troubled economy.Christmastime hiring in the entire area was only about half what it has been over the last five years. From September to December 1990, 10,800 jobs were added in the retail trade, according to Richard Groner of the D.C. Department of Employment Services, which compiles the area statistics. Over the previous five years, the average increase in jobs during the same period was 21,000.In Maryland, which also released its unemployment rate yesterday, joblessness went up from 5.3 percent in November to 6.0 percent in December. Officials of the state Department of Economic and Employment Development said jobs were lost in the construction, auto-manufacturing, restaurant and hotel sectors, among others.The Virginia unemployment rate, released earlier this week, was 4.9 percent in December, up from 4.5 percent the previous month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.429062\n",
      "WASHINGTON  Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in two years as the holiday season failed to lift the spirit of Americans rattled by stock-market volatility and mounting fears of a significant economic slowdown.The Conference Board said consumer confidence slid to 128.3 in December from a revised 132.6 a month earlier. The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop.The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth.Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one.That prospect was very much on the minds of Conference Board officials, who described the fall in confidence as \"somewhat disconcerting.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.424805\n",
      "NEW YORK  A forecaster doesn't have to be especially fearless right now to predict, as most are doing, that inflation will worsen considerably over the next year or so. Business-cycle history suggests it. Indicators that normally presage broad price trends suggest it. The truly fearless forecaster now is the one who maintains that inflation won't worsen markedly in coming months. There are quite a number of them around, and their thinking, however wishful it may ultimately prove to be, seems worth reciting.It may be useful, first, to underline the considerable derring-do that a forecast of low inflation entails. It runs counter to the fact that inflation has worsened in year number three of nearly every long-running economic expansion of the past 30 years. And the reacceleration has often been pronounced. The sharpest speedup was in year three of the 1970-73 upturn, when the overall inflation rate jumped to 7.1% from 4.3% in year two. The current expansion, it should be noted, is in the middle of its second year.A footnote: The postwar record shows that inflation has normally been milder in the second expansion year than in the first. This tendency reflects such usual early-recovery trends as above-average productivity gains, which serve to hold down labor costs, and an absence of costly bottlenecks.Apart from the business cycle, a wide assortment of inflation barometers point to increasing trouble on the price front. Reasonably typical is an indicator compiled by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research. Reflecting such facets of the business scene as credit growth, commodity price movements and employment trends, it has surged some 17% since the expansion's start. That's the sharpest recovery rise in three decades and suggests to the Columbia analysts that prices generally will be sharply rising by late this year or early next. They foresee annual inflation rates of 8% or 9%. That would be roughly double recent rates.Most forecasters, to be sure, are somewhat less pessimistic about the price outlook. But not by a great deal. A recent survey of several dozen forecasters by Eggert Enterprises Inc. of Sedona, Ariz., shows that on average they anticipate steadily accelerating inflation through this year and next, with the annual rate approaching 7%. That would be up from an estimated rise of 4.9% for the current quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                             0.405329\n",
      "High unemployment persists across the country despite the spring pickup in business, a Labor Department report showed yesterday.In mid-July, 89 major job] centers were classed as suffering from substantial labor surplus, with 6 percent, or more of their labor force] out of work.

      "Geographic clusters of interconnected research institutions, businesses and suppliers  think Boston and the biotechnology industry  play a key role in fostering innovation.But not all of these regional systems are created equal. The best ones generate a greater number of jobs, attract more start-ups, and create more new products and services. So what do the most successful clusters have in common?We studied more than 15 on three continents over the past four years. These networks are often anchored by an academic center or research institution, and nurtured by private or government-sponsored development agencies. The academic centers generate a constant stream of ideas and graduates, attracting companies looking for products and services to develop. The companies, in turn, pay royalties to the institutions, creating a virtuous circle of innovation and commercialization.While good science is at the core, we found three other factors to be especially powerful in determining a cluster's competitiveness and growth potential. NEW-VENTURE-ORIENTED: The most-successful clusters are marked by research centers and companies that value innovation and risk-taking.

      "FedEx Corp. threw some cold water on hopes that holiday shoppers would give the uncertain economic outlook a boost.The Memphis, Tenn., shipping giant  regarded as an economic gauge because it handles an average of more than six million packages a day across the world  reduced its profit target for the year because of an economic outlook pinched by the weak U.S. housing market and higher energy prices. The company said that as a result, it would ratchet back on capital spending.\"We believe U.S. [gross domestic product] will grow less than 3%\" for the rest of FedEx's fiscal year, which ends May 30, said FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan B. Graf Jr. He said the company lowered its profit guidance \"almost entirely based on freight market\" and economic forecasts.The reduced outlook overshadowed FedEx's results for the first quarter ended Aug. 31, which rose 4% from a year earlier. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of FedEx fell $2.88 to $104.63.Wall Street had hoped for a lift for sluggish freight-industry volumes from the annual holiday shipping surge. The peak shipping season traditionally begins in late summer and builds into the fall as retailers and other businesses load boats, planes, trains and trucks with products ahead of the holiday shopping crush.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.451070\n",

      "AN INTEREST-RATE BOOST by the Federal Reserve appears all but certain following the release of October jobs data. Unemployment dropped 0.1 percentage point, to 5.8% of the work force. The economy's surprising show of strength put more pressure to fight inflation on the central bank, as it approaches a key policy meeting next week.Bond prices declined on the jobs report, pushing yields to their highest level in more than three years. The Treasury's 30-year bond lost more than 3/4 point, lifting its yield to 8.15%. Stock prices dropped as well.Corporate profits continued to surge in the third quarter. Companies chalked up the strong performance to a healthy U.S. economy, which lifted earnings in virtually every industry, and to manufacturing price gains and improved overseas sales.Stock investors are ignoring the solid quarterly earnings and have begun shifting more assets into cash and bonds. The profit gains have been overshadowed by worries about rising interest rates and inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.430411\n",
      "AS THE stock market teeters nervously downward and certain indicators point to trouble ahead in the economy the search for scapegoats is on. The auto manufacturers are offering up a most improbable candidate in 30-year-old Ralph Nader, a free-lance lawyer-journalist.It is as though his book, Unsafe at Any Speed, had with a single blow punctured the boom. If only by their bungled attempts to discredit Mr. Nader the manufacturers succeeded in creating a David who with a single stone from his sling brought down the Goliath of American industry, representing over-all about one-sixth of the entire economy.M.\\tRoche, president, and George Russell, executive vice president, of General Motors, the industrial colossus with more than half of the business, are walking the corridors of the Senate Office Buildings. Their immediate concern is twofoldÛÓthe criminal penalties for deliberate and willful violation of safety standards and the date when the standards shall be effective. They put their case gently and politely to Sen. Vance Hartke (D-Ind.), who has proposed, along with Rep. James A. Mac-kay (D-Ga.) in the House, amendments that toughen the Administration bill.Mr. Nader is a singularly American phenomenonÛÓthe gadfly, the reformer with a singleness of purpose that gives him the strength of 10. So concentrated is his aim on the engineering safety of the car that even his backers on Capitol Hill are concerned lest other factors in the slaughter on the highways be lost sight of. And that slaughter is just now the reason for renewed agonizing.THE CURVE of death and destruction had been going down. But for the first four months of this year 15,110 persons were killed as compared with 13,650 in the same period in 1965, an increase of 11 per cent. The jump in April with 4400 traffic fatalities was 20 per cent over April a year ago. So ominous is the rise that the president of the National Safety Council, Howard Pyle, warned of totals of tragedy far beyond anything in automotive history. This will help the push for a strong Federal safety standards bill. Whether the responsibility lies with the states or with the Federal Government is one of the bones of contention. For the industry state laws would be less of a problem, and until recently the claim of states rights might have been a convenient refuge from Federal regulation. But a special highway safety panel of the National Governors Conference meeting in Washington reported that auto safety standards were a Federal responsibility.    0.417352\n",
      "NEW YORK, April 7 (AP)ÛÓMotor shares powered a late stock market rally that put the list almost even for the session.Prices of most pivotal Issues joined the rebound to give the market a mixed flavor for the second straight day. Gains and losses swung from fractions to around a dollar.Spearheading the motor recovery were Ford, up more than 2 points, and Chrysler, which added a point. American Motors and Studebaker-Packard both tacked on fractions. General Motors dipped a shade.Brokers traced the resurgence in Ford to strong institutional buying. They reported this revived interest shored buying sentiment in other sections of the market.After opening mixed, the market nosed steadily lower until late afternoon.

      "U.S. unemployment dropped slightly last month and hourly wages rose, evidence of a still-healthy labor market that eased many investors' concerns about a possible economic slowdown.New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, from 4.6 percent the month before, as businesses and government created 97,000 new jobs. Hiring in the health and hospitality industries and a spike in government employment made up for a drop in construction jobs and a continued decline in manufacturing employment.Average hourly wages paid to non-supervisory and production workers rose 6 cents, to $17.16, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier.Though the pace of job creation was slow compared with recent months, the overall report was stronger than expected on Wall Street, giving a small boost to markets that had begun to take a dimmer view of the U.S. economy. Recent reports on economic growth and orders for capital equipment, among other things, pointed to a possible slowdown and contributed to recent volatility in the stock market.Bolstering the outlook further: The monthly U.S. trade deficit fell nearly 3.8 percent in January, to $59.12 billion.

      "The stock market's most closely followed volatility index dropped this past week to its lowest level in nearly two years. Some investors who study volatility believe low readings are a bullish indicator for stocks. Historically, the market has tended to rise as volatility falls, and vice versa.So the latest numbers are a surefire buy signal, right? Not necessarily. Dig a little deeper and you might even spot a contrarian indicator telling you to sell.The Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index, or VIX, is a gauge of investor sentiment. But its predictive power is limited to tallies of trades that have been made in the past. \"The VIX is an important tool,\" says Ben Londergan, co-chief executive of Group One Trading. \"But it's not the be-all and end-all factor to time your entrances and exits to the market.\"The index, launched in 1993 with data stretching back to 1990, moves up and down depending on the price that investors are paying for options on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. When investors buy bearish options on the S&P, known as puts, the options become more expensive and the VIX moves higher. Conversely, when investors sell those put options on the S&P, the options become less expensive and the VIX moves lower.Traders' Expectations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.397963\n",

      "FOR A TIME, there was a reassuring story to tell about the stock market and the economy. Stocks rose in a speculative frenzy, and then fell. But the U.S. economy recovered surprisingly quickly from Sept. 11, aided by the irrepressible American impulse to shop, plus a round of interest-rate cutting. The market was sick. The economy wasn't. Silicon Valley paper millionaires stopped buying Porsches. The rest of us kept buying Chevrolets.The magnitude, the speed and the circumstances of the stock-market decline are threatening that comforting story. Unless the market touches bottom soon  and despite yesterday's spectacular bounce in stock prices, there is no assurance of that  it is going to yank the economy down with it.We may not sink back into recession. But if we have a few more bad weeks on Wall Street, you can rip up those forecasts about the economy growing at a 3.5% annual pace in the second half. Instead, the economy will slow so much that unemployment starts climbing again and the much-delayed resumption of business capital spending will be delayed still further.History offers lots of lessons at a time like this. It's just hard to tell which ones to apply. After the 1987 stock-market crash, consumers paused for a bit, but the economy barely faltered. In 1998, the stock market dropped, and two fantastic years followed. Seven of the 14 bear markets since 1929 didn't coincide with recessions. But seven did, and the damage that a bursting bubble did to Japan is a reminder of how badly things can go awry even in a wealthy, modern economy.The economic fundamentals in the U.S. are still strong. The White House and Alan Greenspan are right about that they aren't mindlessly reciting Herbert Hoover's memoirs. The very resilience of the U.S. economy, so far, has been impressive. And technology's productivity-producing benefits haven't evaporated with all those dot-coms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.502492\n",

Amid the pandemonium of the shop floor, productivity and quality shot through the roof. Major corporations jealously track every dollar and proscribe the actions of every employee, right? Wrong, in the case of the family-owned Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan. Operating mainly in energy and agriculture  industries performing poorly almost everywhere else  Koch has grown bigger than Microsoft, Coke or McDonald's in sales, with no budgets, no central planning and no fixed job descriptions.Economic pundits say small-time middlemen are toast in a high-tech economy.

But not at a chain of used-book outlets called Half Price Books. It has become the largest used-book dealer in the U.S. by expanding into cities where employees and family members have a personal reason to move.For the last four years I've been investigating such rule-breaking success stories in The Front Lines column for this page. But as the case studies piled up  my travels took me to more than 100 cities in 30 states to industries as far-flung as semiconductor design and grease recycling  the unusual seemed more and more like the norm. Everywhere I turned, it seemed, people were succeeding in business by doing the exact opposite of what business had long counted as conventional.Was it possible that these offbeat leaders were becoming the new order of business? Was I witnessing a new ethos or simply some new fads? A new dawn or some new Dilbert fodder? The arrival of a new day or simply the ascendancy of a new generation? These questions forced me to consider business on an unfamiliar new level. What were the most fundamental forces guiding business?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.499423\n",
      "Breaking the Glass for Automobile SalesCall it the parable of the broken windshield.Besides housing and infrastructure, one of the biggest artificial boosts to gross domestic product from superstorm Sandy will come from the auto industry. When November figures are reported this week, the devastation may translate into the best month for light-vehicle sales since the financial crisis. Though the storm only affected the end of October, Edmunds.com notes that 30% of sales typically occur during those days. It estimates some 30,000 sales were deferred, equivalent to 400,000 at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate.Then there is the effect of destroyed or damaged vehicles. The National Crime Insurance Bureau estimates 230,000 cars were damaged by Sandy, with 83% in New York or New Jersey.Estimates for November's seasonally adjusted annual rate of light-vehicle sales are as high as 15.27 million, nearly one million higher than in October.

      "Since you asked for our feedback about your article on SAT tests [\"What the SAT Tests Are Really Scoring,\" Fairfax Extra, Sept. 8], I will give you my two cents as a parent of a Madison High School senior.First of all, unlike you, I am a fan of the SAT. I think it's critical to efficiency in college admissions, given that some school districts practice rampant grade inflation and others (including Fairfax County) do not. Without the objectivity of having SAT grades, colleges would be missing a critical piece of information in their admissions processes. As I am sure you know, studies have indeed found the SAT to be a good and useful predictor of how well kids do in college.On the other hand, I agree with you that the average SAT grade of a school's students doesn't tell one much about whether that school is a good place to learn. After all, even with the changes, it's still pretty much an aptitude test. Thus, it's going to correlate more with IQ than with the quality of teachers. Moreover, if one's goal is to get into the most selective college possible, I think there's probably a decent argument to be made that one may be better off in one of the less elite high schools, taking as many tough courses as possible and perhaps standing out more from the pack.Your Sept. 8 column was a good piece, but it was incomplete because it did not include several relevant factors affecting SAT scores. While poverty does correlate with SAT achievement, a more powerful correlation appears to be culture.Asians in general and the immigrants from some Latin countries have a deep cultural reverence for education that transcends economic status.

But the greenback's gains proved short-lived.Such bond-buying programs, quantitative easing as they are known, are generally seen as corrosive to a currency, because they are viewed in the market as printing money.Mr. Bernanke, delivering day one of his two-day testimony on monetary policy to Congress, defended the Fed's open-ended bond-buying program, saying the associated risks don't outweigh the benefit of \"promoting a stronger economic recovery and more-rapid job creation.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.434460\n",
      "President Reagan is proposing an $8485 billion budget for fiscal 1984 that would barely keep pace with inflation, make deep new domestic spending cuts while increasing military outlays and leave a deficit of $189 billion, congressional leaders were told yesterday -by administration officials. ,Under the plan that Reagan will submit to Congress Monday, overall spending in the fiscal year to begin next Oct. 1 would rise by $43.3 billion. Defense would account for roughly $30 billion of that even though the defense request was cut $8 billion earlier this year.The anticipated $189 billion deficit for the 1984 fiscal year would follow a deficit of $208 billion now projected for the current fiscal 1983 and a deficit of $110.7 billion for 1982, which was a record-setter at the time.The new budget envisions about $43 billion in cuts from the levfels to which spending would rise under current law, including savings from a 6-month delay in cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other federal programs that are tied to inflation, a 12-month freeze of federal pay and retirement benefits and an aggregate, or unevenly applied, freeze of many other domestic programs.Some of the largest cuts would be in health programs, mainly Medicare. Medicare recipients would have to pay more of the cost of routine care. There would be a workfare requirement for food stamp and welfare recipients, and there would be a freeze on farm price support levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.427442\n",
      "Not even the Wizard of Oz slid as swiftly from apparent invincibility to apparent impotence as Indonesia's President Suharto. Now his demise seems readily explainable, as these things always are in retrospect. When his economic miracle morphed into economic crisis, Asia's longest-reigning dictator lost the legitimacy that had masked or excused his regime's many failings while allowing him to buy off potential foes. And when he was forced to kowtow so visibly to the IMF to ensure his nation's survival, he lost the aura of inevitable power that had kept so many of his voiceless subjects living in fear.So what is striking now, in retrospect, is not Suharto's fall  not the apparently frail old man who emerged with trembling voice from behind the Wizard's curtain  but rather how, up until the very last moment, the outside world doubted and disparaged Indonesia's \"People Power.\" Indonesia was not ready for democracy, was the consensus that only Indonesians chose to ignore Suharto could not fall.Why so many held so misguided a view for so long is worth examining now because many of the same voices can be heard again, touting stability over democratic change. The Clinton administration, to its credit, is no longer among them President Clinton quickly recognized Suharto's resignation as only the first step of a necessary process of democratic change. But many others seem ready to send the unruly students home. Enough upheaval for now, is their message let's get back to the business of healing a crippled economy  even though Suharto's repressive system remains, so far, unchanged.Their logic is the same as when they were explaining why Suharto could not be replaced. Indonesia is too poor, and its economy too damaged, to manage a political transition now. The opposition is too fragmented, without ideology or program, united only in its disgust for the nepotism and corruption of the Suharto regime. There is no single opposition leader with the stature to unite a nation of so many islands, religions and ethnic groups.Mix in the absence of viable political parties and civic institutions after 32 years of stifling dictatorial rule. Recall the lack of democratic tradition in a country that has experienced only two transitions in the past half-century, both violent. Add a Javanese culture of patrimonial rule, communal values and mystical respect for power wielded from above.    0.425744\n",
      "The government said yesterday its main economic forecasting gauge plummeted 0.6 percent in April. It was the biggest decline in two years and provided evidence, private economists said, that the U.S. economy is slowing down.The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators posted its biggest setback since a 0.8 percent fall in April 1985.
